"\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of\nthe West\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\nWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\nBy Gregory Maguire\nPrologue\nOn the Yellow Brick Road\nA mile above Oz, the Witch balanced on the wind\u2019s forward edge, as if she were a green fleck\nof the land itself, flung up and sent wheeling away by the turbulent air. \u2018White and purple summer\nthunderheads mounded around her. Below, the Yellow Brick Road looped back on itself, like a\nrelaxed noose. Though winter storms and the crowbars of agitators had torn up the road, still it led,\nrelentlessly, to the Emerald City. The Witch could see the companions trudging along, maneuvering\naround the buckled sections, skirting trenches, skipping when the way was clear. They seemed\noblivious of their fate. But it was not up to the Witch to enlighten them.\nShe used the broom as a sort of balustrade, stepping down from the sky like one of her flying\nmonkeys. She finished up on the topmost bough of a black wiliow tree. Beneath, hidden by the\nfronds, her prey had paused to take their rest. The Witch tucked her broom under her arm. Crablike\nand quiet, she scuttled down a little at a time, until she was a mere twenty feet above them. Wind\nmoved the dangling tendrils of the tree. The Witch stared and listened.\nThere were four of them. She could see a huge Cat of some sort-a Lion, was it?-and a shiny\nwoodman. The Tin Woodman was picking flits out of the Lion\u2019s mane, and the Lion was muttering\nand squirming from the aggravation. An animated Scarecrow lolled nearby, blowing dandelion heads\ninto the wind. The girl was out of sight behind shifting curtains of the willow.\n\u201cOf course, to hear them tell it, it is the surviving sister who is the crazy one,\u201d said the Lion.\n\u201cWhat a Witch. Psychologically warped; possessed by demons. Insane. Not a pretty picture.\u201d\n\u201cShe was castrated at birth,\u201d replied the Tin Woodman calmly. \u201cShe was born hermaphroditic,\nor maybe entirely male.\u201d\n\u201cOh you, you see castration everywhere you look,\u201d said the Lion.\n\u201cI\u2019m only repeating what folks say,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to an opinion,\u201d said the Lion airily. \u201cShe was deprived of a mother\u2019s\nlove, is how I\u2019ve heard it. She was an abused child. She was addicted to medicine for her skin\ncondition.\u201d\n\u201cShe has been unlucky in love,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201clike the rest of us.\u201d The Tin Woodman\npaused and placed his hand on the center of his chest, as if in grief.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a woman who prefers the company of other women,\u201d said the Scarecrow, sitting up.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the spurned lover of a married man.\u201d\n\u201cShe is a married man.\u201d\nThe Witch was so stunned that she nearly lost her grip on the branch. The last thing she ever\ncared for was gossip. Yet she had been out of touch for so long that she was astonished at the\nvigorous opinions of these random nobodies.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a despot. A dangerous tyrant,\u201d said the Lion with conviction.\nThe Tin Woodman pulled harder than was necessary on a lock of mane. \u201cEverything\u2019s\ndangerous to you, you craven thing. I hear she\u2019s a champion of home rule for the so-called Winkles.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever she is, she must surely be grieving the death of her sister,\u201d said the child, in a somber\nvoice too rich, too sincere for one so young. The Witch\u2019s skin crawled.\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t go feeling sympathetic now. I certainly can\u2019t.\u201d The Tin Woodman sniffed, a bit\ncynically.\n\u201cBut Dorothy\u2019s right,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cNo one is exempt from grief.\u201d\nThe Witch was deeply irked by their patronizing speculations. She moved around the trunk of\nthe tree, stretching to catch a glimpse of the child. The wind was picking up, and the Scarecrow\nshivered. While the Tin Woodman continued fussing over the Lion\u2019s tresses, he leaned against the\nLion, who held him tenderly. \u201cStorm on the horizon,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\nMiles off, thunder echoed. \u201cThere-is-a-Witch on the horizon,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, tickling\nthe Lion. The Lion got spooked and rolled on top of the Scarecrow, whimpering, and the Tin\nWoodman collapsed on top of them both.\n\u201cGood friends, should we be wary of that storm?\u201d said the girl.\nThe rising winds moved the curtain of greenery at last, and the Witch caught sight of the girl.\nShe was sitting with her feet tucked underneath her and her arms wrapped around her knees. She was\nnot a dainty thing but a good-size farm girl, dressed in blue-and-white checks and a pinafore. In her\nlap, a vile little dog cowered and whined.\n\u201cThe storm makes you skittish. It\u2019s natural after what you\u2019ve been through,\u201d said the Tin\nWoodman. \u201cRelax.\u201d\nThe Witch\u2019s fingers dug into the bark of the tree. She still could not see the girl\u2019s face, just her\nstrong forearms and the crown of her head where her dark hair was pulled back into pigtails. Was\nshe to be taken seriously, or was she merely a blow-away dandelion seed, caught on the wrong side\nof the wind? If she could see the girl\u2019s face, the Witch felt she might know.\nBut as the Witch craned outward from the trunk, the girl at the same time twisted her face,\nturning away. \u201cThat storm is coming closer, and in a hurry.\u201d The feeling in her voice rose as the\nwind rose. She had a throaty vehemence, like someone arguing through the threat of impending tears.\n\u201cI know storms, I know how they come upon you!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re safer here,\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\n\u201cCertainly we are not,\u201d answered the girl, \u201cbecause this tree is the highest point around, and if\nlightning is to strike, it will strike here.\u201d She clutched her dog. \u201cDidn\u2019t we see a shed farther up the\nroad? Come, come; Scarecrow, if there\u2019s lightning, you\u2019ll burn the fastest! Come on!\u201d\nShe was up and running in an ungainly way, and her companions followed in a mounting panic.\nAs the first hard drops of rain fell, the Witch caught sight, not of the girl\u2019s face, but of the shoes. Her\nsister\u2019s shoes. They sparkled even in the darkening afternoon. They sparkled like yellow diamonds,\nand embers of blood, and thorny stars.\nIf she had seen the shoes first, the Witch would never have been able to listen to the girl or her\nfriends. But the girl\u2019s legs had been tucked beneath her skirt. Now the Witch was reminded of her\nneed. The shoes should be hers!-hadn\u2019t she endured enough, hadn\u2019t she earned them? The Witch\nwould fall on the girl from the sky, and wrestle those shoes off her impertinent feet, if only she could.\nBut the storm from which the companions raced, farther and faster along the Yellow Brick\nRoad, troubled the Witch more than it did the girl\nwho had gone through rain and the Scarecrow whom lightning could burn. The Witch could not\nventure out in such a vicious, insinuating wetness. Instead, she had to tuck herself between some\nexposed roots of the black willow tree, where no water could endanger her, and wait for the storm to\npass.\nShe would emerge. She always had before. The punishing political climate of Oz had beat her\ndown, dried her up, tossed her away-like a seedling she had drifted, apparently too desiccated ever\nto take root. But surely the curse was on the land of Oz, not on her. Though Oz had given her a\ntwisted life, hadn\u2019t it also made her capable?\n\n\fNo matter that the companions had hurried away. The Witch could wait. They would meet\nagain.\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\n\n\fBook 1 - Munchkinlanders\nFrom the crumpled bed the wife said, \u201cI think today\u2019s the day. Look how I\u2019ve gone.\u201d\n\u201cToday? That would be like you, perverse and inconvenient,\u201d said her husband, teasing her,\nstanding at the doorway and looking outward, over the lake, the fields, the forested slopes beyond.\nHe could just make out the chimneys of Rush Margins, breakfast fires smoking. \u201cThe worst possible\nmoment for my ministry. Naturally.\u201d\nThe wife yawned. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of choice involved. From what I hear. Your body gets this\nbig and it takes over-if you can\u2019t accommodate it, sweetheart, you just get out of its way. It\u2019s on a\ntrack of its own and nothing stops it now.\u201d She pushed herself up, trying to see over the rise of her\nbelly. \u201cI feel like a hostage to myself. Or to the baby.\u201d\n\u201cExert some self-control.\u201d He came to her side and helped her sit up. \u201cThink of it as a spiritual\nexercise. Custody of the senses. Bodily as well as ethical continence.\u201d\n\u201cSelf-control?\u201d She laughed, inching toward the edge of the bed. \u201cI have no self left. I\u2019m only a\nhost for the parasite. Where\u2019s my self anyway? Where\u2019d I leave that tired old thing?\u201d\n\u201cThink of me.\u201d His tone had changed; he meant this.\n\u201cFrex\u201d-she headed him off-\u201cwhen the volcano\u2019s ready there\u2019s no priest in the world can pray it\nquiet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will my fellow ministers think?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get together and say, \u2018Brother Frexspar, did you allow your wife to deliver your first\nchild when you had a community problem to solve? How inconsiderate of you; it shows a lack of\nauthority. You\u2019re fired from the position.\u201d She was ribbing him now, for there was no one to fire\nhim. The nearest bishop was too distant to pay attention to the particulars of a unionist cleric in\nthe hinterland.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such terrible timing.\u201d\n\u201cI do think you bear half the blame for the timing,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, after all, Frex.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the thinking goes, but I wonder.\u201d\n\u201cYou wonder?\u201d She laughed, her head going far back. The line from her ear to the hollow\nbelow her throat reminded Frex of an elegant silver ladle. Even in morning disarray, with a belly\nlike a scow, she was majestically good-looking. Her hair had the bright lacquered look of wet fallen\noak leaves in sunlight. He blamed her for being born to privilege and admired her efforts to\novercome it-and all the while he loved her, too.\n\u201cYou mean you wonder if you\u2019re the father\u201d-she grabbed the bedstead; Frex took hold of her\nother arm and hauled her half-upright-\u201cor do you question the fatherliness of men in general?\u201d She\nstood, mammoth, an ambulatory island. Moving out the door at a slug\u2019s pace, she laughed at such an\nidea. He could hear her laughing from the outhouse even as he began to dress for the day\u2019s battle.\nFrex combed his beard and oiled his scalp. He fastened a clasp of bone and rawhide at the nape\nof his neck, to keep the hair out of his face, because his expressions today had to be readable from a\ndistance: There could be no fuzziness to his meaning. He applied some coal dust to darken his\neyebrows, a smear of red wax on his flat cheeks. He shaded his lips. A handsome priest attracted\nmore penitents than a homely one.\nIn the kitchen yard Melena floated gently, not with the normal gravity of pregnancy but as if\ninflated, a huge balloon trailing its strings through the dirt. She carried a skillet in one hand and a\nfew eggs and the whiskery tips of autumn chives in the other. She sang to herself, but only in short\nphrases. Frex wasn\u2019t meant to hear her.\nHis sober gown buttoned tight to the collar, his sandals strapped on over leggings, Frex took\n\n\ffrom its hiding place-beneath a chest of drawers-the report sent to him from his fellow minister over\nin the village of Three Dead Trees. He hid the brown pages within his sash. He had been keeping\nthem from his wife, afraid that she would want to come along-to see the fun, if it was amusing, or to\nsuffer the thrill of it if it was terrifying.\nAs Frex breathed deeply, readying his lungs for a day of oratory, Melena dangled a wooden\nspoon in the skillet and stirred the eggs. The tinkle of cowbells sounded across the lake. She did not\nlisten; or she listened but to something else, to something inside her. It was sound without melodylike dream music, remembered for its effect but not for its harmonic distresses and recoveries. She\nimagined it was the child inside her, humming for happiness. She knew he would be a singing child.\nMelena heard Frex inside, beginning to extemporize, warming up, calling forth the rolling\nphrases of his argument, convincing himself again of his righteousness.\nHow did that proverb go, the one that Nanny singsonged to her, years ago, in the nursery?\nBorn in the morning,\nWoe without warning;\nAfternoon child\nWoeful and wild;\nBorn in the evening,\nWoe ends in grieving.\nNight baby borning\nSame as the morning.\nBut she remembered this as a joke, fondly. Woe is the natural end of life, yet we go on having\nbabies.\nNo, said Nanny, an echo in Melena\u2019s mind (and editorializing as usual): No, no, you pretty little\npampered hussy. We don\u2019t go on having babies, that\u2019s quite apparent. We only have babies when\nwe\u2019re young enough not to know how grim life turns out. Once we really get the full measure of itwe\u2019re slow learners, we women-we dry up in disgust and sensibly halt production.\nBut men don\u2019t dry up, Melena objected; they can father to the death.\nAh, we\u2019re slow learners, Nanny countered. But they can\u2019t learn at all.\n\u201cBreakfast,\u201d said Melena, spooning eggs onto a wooden plate. Her son would not be as dull as\nmost men. She would raise him up to defy the onward progress of woe.\n\u201cIt is a time of crisis for our society,\u201d recited Frex. For a man who condemned worldly\npleasures he ate with elegance. She loved to watch the arabesque of fingers and two forks. She\nsuspected that beneath his righteous asceticism he possessed a hidden longing for the easy life.\n\u201cEvery day is a great crisis for our society.\u201d She was being flip, answering him in the terms\nmen use. Dear thick thing, he didn\u2019t hear the irony in her voice.\n\u201cWe stand at a crossroads. Idolatry looms. Traditional values in jeopardy. Truth under siege\nand virtue abandoned.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t talking to her so much as practicing his tirade against the coming spectacle of\nviolence and magic. There was a side to Frex that verged on despair; unlike most men, he was able\nto channel it to benefit his life\u2019s work. With some difficulty she set herself down on a bench. Whole\nchoruses were singing wordlessly inside her head! Was this common for every labor and delivery?\nShe would have liked to ask the nosy local women who would come around this afternoon, growling\nshyly at her condition. But she didn\u2019t dare. She couldn\u2019t jettison her pretty accent, which they found\naffected-but she could avoid sounding ignorant about these basic matters.\nFrex noticed her silence. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry I\u2019m leaving you today?\u201d\n\u201cAngry?\u201d She raised her eyebrows, as if she had never encountered the concept before.\n\u201cHistory crawls along on the peg legs of small individual lives,\u201d said Frex, \u201cand at the same\n\n\ftime larger eternal forces converge. You can\u2019t attend to both arenas at once.\u201d\n\u201cOur child may not have a small life.\u201d\n\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to argue. Do you want to distract me from holy work today? We\u2019re facing\nthe presence of real evil in Rush Margins. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I ignored it.\u201d He meant this,\nand for such intensity she had fallen in love with him; but she hated him for it too, of course.\n\u201cThreats come-they\u2019ll come again.\u201d Her last word on the subject. \u201cYour son will only be born\nonce, and if this watery upheaval inside is any indication, I think it\u2019s today.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be other children.\u201d\nShe turned away so he could not see the rage in her face.\nBut she couldn\u2019t sustain the fury at him. Perhaps this was her moral failing. (She wasn\u2019t much\ngiven to worrying about moral failings as a rule; having a minister as a husband seemed to stir\nenough religious thought for one couple.) She lapsed sullenly into silence. Frex nibbled at his meal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the devil,\u201d said Frex, sighing. \u201cThe devil is coming.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say a thing like that on a day our child is expected!\u201d\n\u201cI mean the temptation in Rush Margins! And you know what I mean, Melena!\u201d\n\u201cWords are words, and what\u2019s said is said!\u201d she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t require all your attention,\nFrex, but I do need some of it!\u201d She dropped the skillet with a crash on the bench that stood against\nthe cottage wall.\n\u201cWell, and likewise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m up against today? How can I convince\nmy flock to turn away from the razzle-dazzle spectacle of idolatry? I will probably come back\ntonight having lost to a smarter attraction. You might achieve a child today. I look forward to\nfailure.\u201d Still, as he said this he looked proud; to fail in the cause of a high moral concern was\nsatisfying to him. How could it compare with the flesh, blood, mess, and noise of having a baby?\nHe stood at last to leave. A wind came up over the lake now, smudging the topmost reaches of\nthe columns of kitchen smoke. They looked, thought Melena, like funnels of water swirling down\ndrains in narrowing, focusing spirals.\n\u201cBe well, my love,\u201d said Frex, although he had his stern public expression on, from forehead to\ntoes.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Melena sighed. The child punched her, deep down, and she had to hurry to the outhouse\nagain. \u201cBe holy, and I\u2019ll be thinking of you-my backbone, my breastplate. And also try not to be\nkilled.\u201d\n\u201cThe will of the Unnamed God,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cMy will too,\u201d she said, blasphemously.\n\u201cApply your will to that which deserves it,\u201d he answered. Now he was the minister and she the\nsinner, an arrangement she did not particularly enjoy.\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d she said, and chose the stink and relief of the outhouse over standing to wave him\nout of sight as he strode along the road to Rush Margins.\nFrex was more concerned for Melena than she knew. He stopped at the first fisherman\u2019s hut he\nsaw and spoke with the man at the half-door. Could a woman or two spend the day and if needed the\nnight with Melena? It would be a kindness. Frex nodded with a wince of gratitude, acknowledging\nwithout words that Melena was not a great favorite in these parts.\nThen, before continuing around the end of Illswater and over to Rush Margins, he stopped at a\nfallen tree and drew two letters from his sash.\nThe writer was a distant cousin of Frex\u2019s, also a minister. Weeks earlier the cousin had spent\nrime and valuable ink on a description of what was being called the Clock of the Time Dragon. Frex\nprepared himself for the day\u2019s holy campaign by rereading about the idol clock.\nI write in haste, Brother Frexspar, to catch my impressions before they fade.\n\n\fThe Clock of the Time Dragon is mounted on a wagon and stands as high as a giraffe. It is\nnothing more than a tottering, freestanding theatre, punched on all four sides with alcoves and\nproscenium arches. On the flat roof is a clockwork dragon, an invention of green painted\nleather, silvery claws, ruby jeweled eyes. Its skin is made of hundreds of overlapping discs of\ncopper, bronze, and iron. Beneath the flexible folds of its scales is an armature controlled by\nclockwork. The Time Dragon circles on its pedestal, flexes its narrow leathery wings (they make a\nsound like a bellows), and belches out sulfurous balls of flaming orange stink.\nBelow, featured in the dozens of doorways, windows, and porches, are puppets, marionettes,\nfigurines. Creatures of folk tale. Caricatures of peasants and royalty alike. Animals and fairies and\nsaints-our unionist saints, Brother Frexspar, stolen out from underneath us! I get enraged. The figures\nmove on sprockets. They wheel in and out of doorways. They bend at the waist, they dance and\ndawdle and daily with each other.\nWho had engendered this Time Dragon, this fake oracle, this propaganda tool for wickedness\nthat challenged the power of unionism and of the Unnamed God? The clock\u2019s handlers were a dwarf\nand some narrow-waisted minions who seemed to have only enough brain capacity among them to\npass a hat. Who else was benefiting besides the dwarf and his beauty boys?\nThe cousin\u2019s second letter had warned that the clock was making its way next to Rush Margins.\nIt had told a more specific story.\nThe entertainment began with a thrum of strings and a rattle of bones. The crowd pushed close,\noohing. Within the lighted window of a stage, we saw a marriage bed, with a puppet wife and\nhusband. The husband was asleep and the wife sighed. She made a motion with her carved hands to\nsuggest that her husband was disappointingly small. The audience shrieked with laughter. The puppet\nwife went to sleep herself. \u2018When she was snoring, the puppet husband sneaked Out of bed.\nAt this point, up above, the Dragon turned on its base, and pointed its talons into the crowd,\nindicating_without a doubt- a humble well digger named Grine, who has been a faithful if inattentive\nhusband. Then the dragon reared back and stretched two fingers in a come-hither gesture, isolating a\nwidow named Letta and her snaggle-toothed maiden daughter. The crowd hushed and fell away from\nCrine, Letta, and the blushing maid, as if they had suddenly been inflicted with running sores.\nThe Dragon rested again but draped a wing over another archway, which lit up to reveal the\npuppet husband, wandering out in the night. Along came a puppet widow, with sprigged hair\nand high color, dragging along a protesting, flinty-toothed daughter. The kissed the puppet\nhusband, and pulled off his leather trousers. He was equipped with two full sets of male goods, one\nin the front and another hanging off the base of his spine. The widow positioned her daughter on the\nabbreviated prong in the front, and herself took advantage of the morning arrangement in the rear.\nThe three puppets bucked and rocked, emitting squeals of glee. When the puppet widow and her\ndaughter were through, they dismounted and kissed the adulterous puppet husband. Then they kneed\nhim, simultaneously, fore and aft. He swung on springs and hinges, trying to hold all his wounded\nparts.\nThe audience roared. Crine, the actual well digger, sweated drops as big as grapes. Letta\npretended to guffaw, but her daughter had already disappeared from shame. Before the evening was\nout, Crine was set upon by his agitated neighbors and investigated for the grotesque anomaly. Letta\nwas shunned. Her daughter seems to have vanished entirely. We suspect the worst.\nAt least Grine wasn t killed. Yet who can say how our souls have been stamped by witnessing\nsuch a cruel drama? All souls are hostages to their human envelopes, but souls must decay and suffer\nat much indignity, don\u2019 t you agree?\nSometimes it seemed to Frex that every itinerant witch and toothless gibbering seer in Oz who\ncould perform even the most transparent of spells had seized on the outback district of Wend\n\n\fHardings to scratch out a trade. He knew that folks from Rush Margins were humble. Their lives\nwere hard and their hopes few. As the drought dragged on, their traditional unionist faith was\neroding. Frex was aware that the Clock of the Time Dragon combined the appeals of ingenuity and\nmagic-and he would have to call on his deepest reserves of religious conviction to overcome it. If\nhis congregation should prove vulnerable to the so-called pleasure faith, succumbing to spectacle\nand violence-well, what next?\nHe would prevail. He was their minister. He had pulled their teeth and buried their babies and\nblessed their kitchen pots for years now. He had abased himself in their names. He had wandered\nwith an unkempt\nbeard and a begging bowl from hamlet to hamlet, leaving poor Melena alone in the minister\u2019s\nlodge for weeks at a time. He had sacrificed for them. They couldn\u2019t be swayed by this Time Dragon\ncreature. They owed him.\nHe moved on, shoulders squared, jaw set, stomach in a sour uproar. The sky was brown with\nflying sand and grit. The wind rushed high over the bills with the sound of a tremulous wail, as if\npushing through some fissure of rock, on a ridge beyond any Frex could see.\nIt was nearly evening by the time Frex had worked up the courage to enter the ramshackle\nhamlet of Rush Margins. He was in a deep sweat. He hit his heels to the ground and pumped his\nclenched fists, and called out in a hoarse, carrying tone. \u201cHist, oh ye of small confidence! Gather\nwhile ye may, for temptation is abroad, to try ye sorely!\u201d The words were archaic, even ridiculous,\nbut they worked. Here came the sullen fishermen, dragging their empty nets up from the dock. Here\ncame the subsistence farmers, whose hardscrabble plots had borne little during this dry year. Before\nhe had even begun, they all looked guilty as sin.\nThey followed him to the rickety steps of the canoe repair house. Frex knew that everyone\nexpected this evil clock to arrive at any instant; gossip was as contagious as the plague. He yelled at\nthem for their thirsty anticipation. \u201cYe are dull as toddlers reaching their hands to touch the pretty\nembers! Ye are as if spawn of dragon womb, ready to suck on teats of fire!\u201d These were time-worn\nscriptural imprecations and they fell a little flat tonight; he was tired and not at his best.\n\u201cBrother Frexspar,\u201d said Bree, the mayor of Rush Margins, \u201ccould you perhaps tone down your\nharangue until we get a chance to see what fresh new form temptation might take?\u201d\n\u201cYou have no mettle to resist new forms,\u201d said Frex, spitting.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you been our able teacher- these several years?\u201d said Bree. \u201cWe\u2019ve hardly had such a\ngood chance to prove ourselves against sin! We\u2019re looking forward to-to the spiritual test of it all.\u201d\nThe fishermen laughed and jeered, and Frex intensified his glower, but at the sound of\nunfamiliar wheels in the stony ruts of the road, they all turned their heads and fell silent. He had lost\ntheir attention before he had gotten started.\nThe clock was being drawn by four horses and escorted by the dwarf and his cohort of young\nthugs. Its broad roof was crowned by the dragon. But what a beast! It looked poised as if ready to\nspring, as if indeed invested with life. The skin of the house was decorated in carnival colors,\nburnished with gold leaf. The fishermen gaped as it drew near.\nBefore the dwarf could announce the time of the performance, before the crowd of youths could\ndraw out their clubs, Frex leaped on the lower step of the thing-a fold-down stage on hinges. \u201cWhy\nis this thing called a clock? The only clock face it has is flat, dull, and lost in all that distracting\ndetail. Furthermore, the hands don\u2019t move: Look, see for yourselves! They\u2019re painted to remain at\none minute before midnight! All you\u2019ll see here is mechanics, my friends: I know this for a fact.\nYou\u2019ll see mechanical cornfields growing, moons waxing and waning, a volcano to spew a soft red\ncloth done up with black and red sequins. With all this tiktoky business, why not have a pair of\ncirculating arms on the clock face? Why not? I ask you, I\u2019m asking you, yes, you, Gawnette, and you,\n\n\fStoy, and you, Perippa. Why no real clock here?\u201d\nThey were not listening, Gawnette and Stoy and Perippa, nor were the others. They were too\nbusy staring in anticipation.\n\u201cThe answer, of course, is that the clock isn\u2019t meant to measure earthly time, but the time of the\nsoul. Redemption and condemnation time. For the soul, each instant is always a minute short of\njudgment.\n\u201cOne minute short of judgment, my friends! If you died in the next sixty seconds, would you\nwant to spend eternity in the suffocating depths reserved for idolaters?\u201d\n\u201cAwful lot of noise in the neighborhood tonight,\u201d said someone in the shadows-and the\nspectators laughed. Above Frex-he whirled to see-from a little door had emerged a small, yapping\npuppet dog, its hair dark and as tightly curled as Frex\u2019s own. The dog bounced on a spring, and the\npitch of its chatter was annoyingly high. The laughter grew. Evening fell harder, and it was less easy\nfor Frex to tell who was laughing, who now was shouting for him to move aside so they could see.\nHe wouldn\u2019t move, so he was bundled unceremoniously from his perch. The dwarf gave a\npoetic welcome. \u201cAll our lives are activity without meaning; we burrow rat-like into life and we\nsquirm rat-like through it and rat-like we are flung into our graves at the end. Now and then, why\nshouldn\u2019t we\nhear a voice of prophecy, or see a miracle play? Beneath the apparent sham and indignity of our\nrat-like lives, a humble pattern and meaning still applies! Come nearer, my good people, and watch\nwhat a little extra knowledge augurs for your lives! The Time Dragon sees before and beyond and\nwithin the truth of your sorry span of years here! Look at what it shows you!\u201d\nThe crowd pushed forward. The moon had risen, its light like the eye of an angry, vengeful god.\n\u201cGive over, let me go,\u201d Frex called; it was worse than he had thought. He had never been\nmanhandled by his own congregation.\nThe clock unfolded story about a publicly pious man, with lamb\u2019s wool beard and dark curly\nlocks, who preached simplicity, poverty, and generosity while keeping a hidden coffer of gold and\nemeralds-in the double-hinged bosom of a weak-chinned daughter of blue blood society. The\nscoundrel was run through with a long iron stake in a most indelicate way and served up to his\nhungry flock as Roast Flank of Minister.\n\u201cThis panders to your basest instincts!\u201d Frex yelled, his arms folded and his face magenta with\nfury.\nBut now that darkness was almost total, someone came up from behind him to silence him. An\narm encircled his neck. He twisted to see which damned parishioner took such liberties, but all the\nfaces were cloaked by hoods. He was kneed in the groin and doubled over, his face in the dirt. A\nfoot kicked him square between the buttocks and his bowels released. The rest of the crowd,\nhowever, was not watching. They were howling with mirth at some other entertainment put on by the\nClock Dragon. A sympathetic woman in a widow\u2019s shawl grabbed his arm and led him away-he was\ntoo fouled, too much in pain to straighten up and see who it was. \u201cI\u2019ll put you down in the root\ncellar, I will, under a burlap,\u201d crooned the goodwife, \u201cfor they\u2019ll be after you tonight with\npitchforks, the way that thing is behaving itself They\u2019ll look for you in your lodge, but they won\u2019t\nlook in my keeping room.\u201d\n\u201cMelena,\u201d he croaked, \u201cthey\u2019ll find her-\u201c\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be seen to,\u201d said his neighbor. \u201cWe women can manage that much, I guess!\u201d\nIn the minister\u2019s lodge, Melena struggled with consciousness as a pair of midwives went in and\nout of focus before her. One was a fishwife, the\nother a palsied crone; they took turns feeling tier forehead, peeing between her legs, and\nstealing glances at the few beautiful trinkets and treasures Melena had managed to bring here from\n\n\fCoiwen Grounds.\n\u201cYou chew that paste of pinlobble leaves, duckie, you do that. You\u2019ll be unconscious before\nyou know it,\u201d said the fishwife. \u201cYou\u2019ll relax, out will pop the little sweetheart, and all will be well\nin the morning. Thought you would smell of rosewater and fairy dew, but you stink like the rest of us.\nChew on, my duckie, chew on.\u201d\nAt the sound of a knock, the crone looked up guiltily from the chest she was kneeling before and\nrummaging through. She let the lid close with a bang and affected a position of prayer, eyes closed.\n\u201cEnter,\u201d she called.\nA maiden with tender skin and high color came in. \u201cOh, I hoped someone would be here,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHow is she?\u201d\n\u201cNearly out and so is the babe,\u201d answered the fishwife. \u201cAn hour more, I reckon.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m told to warn you. The men are drunk and on the prowl. They\u2019ve been riled up by that\ndragon of the magic clock, you know, and are looking for Frex to kill him. The clock said to. They\u2019ll\nlikely stagger out here. We\u2019d better get the wife safely away-can she be moved?\u201d\nNo, I cannot be moved, thought Melena, and if the peasants find Frex tell them to kill him good\nand hard for me, for I never knew a pain so extraordinary that it made me see the blood behind my\nown eyes. Kill him for doing this to me. At this thought, she smiled in a moment of relief and passed\nout.\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave her here and run for it!\u201d said the maiden. \u201cThe clock said to kill her too, and the\nlittle dragon she\u2019s going to give birth to. I don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our own reputations to uphold,\u201d said the fishwife. \u201cWe can\u2019t abandon the fancy\nladything in mid-delivery. I don\u2019t care what any clock says.\u201d\nThe crone, her head back in the chest, said, \u201cAnyone for some real lace from Gillikin?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hay cart in the lower field, but let\u2019s do it now,\u201d said the fishwife. \u201cCome, help me\nfetch it. You, old mother hag, get your face out of the linens and come dampen this pretty pink brow.\nRight-o, now we go.\u201d\nA few minutes later the crone, the wife, and the maiden were trundling the hay cart along a\nrarely used track through the spindles and bracken of the autumn woods. The wind had picked up. It\nwhistled over the treeless foreheads of the Cloth Hills. Melena, sprawled in blankets, heaved and\nmoaned in unconscious pain.\nThey heard a drunken mob pass, with pitchforks and torches, and the women stood silent and\nterrified, listening to the slurred curses. Then they pressed on with greater urgency until they came\nupon a foggy copse-the edge of the graveyard for unconsecrated corpses. Within it they saw the\nblurred outlines of the clock. It had been left here for safekeeping by the dwarf-no fool he; he could\nguess this particular corner of the world was the last place jumpy villagers would seek tonight. \u201cThe\ndwarf and his boykins were drinking in the tavern too,\u201d said the maiden breathlessly. \u201cThere\u2019s no\none here to stop us!\u201d\nThe crone said, \u201cSo you\u2019ve been peering in the tavern windows at the men, you slut?\u201d She\npushed open the door in the back of the clock.\nShe found a crawl space. Pendulums hung ominously in the gloom. Huge toothed wheels looked\nprimed to slice any trespasser into sausage rounds. \u201cCome on, drag her in,\u201d said the crone.\nThe night of torches and fog gave way, at dawn, to broad bluffs of thundercloud, dancing\nskeletons of lightning. Glimpses of blue sky appeared briefly, though sometimes it rained so hard that\nit seemed more like mud drops falling than water. The midwives, crawling on hands and knees out of\nthe back of the clock-wagon, had their little discharge at last. They protected the infant from the\ndripping gutter. \u201cLook, a rainbow,\u201d said the senior, bobbing her head. A sickly scarf of colored light\nhung in the sky.\n\n\fWhat they saw, rubbing the caul and blood off the skin-was it just a trick of the light? After all,\nfollowing the storm the grass did seem to throb with its own color, the roses zinged and hovered\nwith crazy glory on their stems. But even with these effects of light and atmosphere, the midwives\ncouldn\u2019t deny what they saw. Beneath the spit of the mother\u2019s fluids the infant glistened a scandalous\nshade of pale emerald.\nThere was no wail, no bark of newborn outrage. The child opened its mouth, breathed, and then\nkept its own counsel. \u201cWhine, you fiend,\u201d said the crone, \u201cit\u2019s your first job.\u201d The baby shirked its\nobligations.\n\u201cAnother willful boy,\u201d said the fishwife, sighing. \u201cShall we kill it?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so nasty to it,\u201d said the crone, \u201cit\u2019s a girl.\u201d\n\u201cHah,\u201d said the bleary-eyed maiden, \u201clook again, there\u2019s the weather vane.\u201d\nFor a minute they were in disagreement, even with the child naked before them. Only after a\nsecond and third rub was it clear that the child was indeed feminine. Perhaps in labor some bit of\norganic effluvia had become caught and quickly dried in the cloven place. Once toweled, she was\nobserved to be prettily formed, with a long elegant head, forearms nicely turned out, clever pinching\nlittle buttocks, cunning fingers with scratchy little nails.\nAnd an undeniable green cast to the skin. There was a salmon blush in the cheeks and belly, a\nbeige effect around the clenched eyelids, a tawny stripe on the scalp showing the pattern of eventual\nhair. But the primary effect was vegetable.\n\u201cLook what we get for our troubles,\u201d said the maiden. \u201cA little green pat of butter. Why don\u2019t\nwe kill it? You know what people will say.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s rotten,\u201d said the fishwife, and checked for the root of a tail, counted fingers and\ntoes. \u201cIt smells like dung.\u201d\n\u201cThat is dung you\u2019re smelling, you idiot. You\u2019re squatting in a cow pattypie.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sick, it\u2019s feeble, that\u2019s why the color. Lose it in the puddle, drown the thing. She\u2019ll never\nknow. She\u2019ll be out for hours in her ladylike faints.\u201d\nThey giggled. They cradled the infant in the crook of their arms, passing it around to test it for\nweight and balance. To kill it was the kindest course of action. The question was how.\nThen the child yawned, and the fishwife absentmindedly gave it a finger to nurse on, and the\nchild bit the finger off at the second knuckle. It almost choked on the gush of blood. The digit\ndropped out of its mouth into the mud like a bobbin. The women catapulted into action. The fishwife\nlunged to strangle the girl, and the crone and the maiden flared up in defense. The finger was dug out\nof the mire and shoved in an apron pocket, possibly to sew back onto the hand that had lost it. \u201cIt\u2019s a\ncock, she just realized she didn\u2019t have one,\u201d screeched the maiden, and\nfell on the ground laughing. \u201cOh, beware the stupid boy first tries to please himself with her!\nShe\u2019ll snip his young sprout off for a souvenir!\u201d\nThe midwives crawled back into the clock and dropped the thing at its mother\u2019s breast, afraid\nto consider mercy murder for fear of what else the baby might bite. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll chop the tit next,\nthat\u2019ll bring Her Drowsy Frailness around quick enough,\u201d the crone chuckled. \u201cThough what a child,\nthat sips blood even before its first suck of mother\u2019s milk!\u201d They left a pipkin of water nearby, and\nunder cover of the next squall they went squelching away, to find their sons and husbands and\nbrothers, and berate and beat them if they were available, or bury them if not.\nIn the shadows, the infant stared overhead at the oiled and regular teeth of time\u2019s clock.\nFor days Melena couldn\u2019t bear to look at the thing. She held it, as a mother must. She waited for\nthe groundwater of maternal affection to rise and overwhelm her. She did not weep. She chewed\npinlobble leaves, to float away from the disaster.\nIt was a she. It was a her. Melena practiced conversions in her thinking when she was alone.\n\n\fThe twitching, unhappy bundle was not male; it was not neutered; it was a female. It slept, looking\nlike a heap of cabbage leaves washed and left to drain on the table.\nIn a panic, Melena wrote to Coiwen Grounds to drag Nanny from her retirement. Frex went\nahead in a carriage to collect Nanny from the way station at Stonespar End. On the trip back, Nanny\nasked Frex what was wrong.\n\u201cWhat is wrong.\u201d He sighed, and was lost in thought. Nanny realized she had chosen her words\npoorly; now Frex was distracted. He began to mumble in a general way about the nature of evil. A\nvacuum set up by the inexplicable absence of the Unnamed God, and into which spiritual poison must\nrush. A vortex.\n\u201cI mean what is the state of the child!\u201d retorted Nanny explosively. \u201cIt\u2019s not the universe but a\nsingle child I need to hear about, if I\u2019m going to be any help! Why does Melena call for me instead of\nfor her mother? Why is there no letter for her grandfather? He\u2019s the Eminent Thropp, for goodness\nsakes! Melena can\u2019t have forgotten her duties so thoroughly, or is life out there in the country worse\nthan we thought?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than we thought,\u201d said Frex grimly. \u201cThe baby-you had better be prepared, Nanny,\nso you don\u2019t scream-the baby is damaged.\u201d\n\u201cDamaged?\u201d Nanny\u2019s grip on her valise tightened and she looked out over the red-leafed\npearlfruit trees by the side of the road. \u201cFrex, tell me everything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cDamage indeed,\u201d said Nanny mockingly, but Frex as usual missed the dig. \u201cWell, at least the\nfamily title\u2019s preserved for another generation. Has she got all her limbs?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAny more than she needs?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIs she sucking?\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let it. It has extraordinary teeth, Nanny. It has shark\u2019s teeth, or something like.\u201d\n\u201cWell she won\u2019t be the first child to grow on a bottle or a rag instead of a tit, don\u2019t worry about\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong color,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cWhat color is the wrong color?\u201d\nFor a few moments Frex could only shake his head. Nanny did not like him and she would not\nlike him, but she softened. \u201cFrex, it can\u2019t be that bad. There\u2019s always a way out. Tell Nanny.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s green,\u201d he finally said. \u201cNanny, it\u2019s green as moss.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s green, you mean. It\u2019s a she, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Frex began to weep. \u201cHeaven is not improved by it, Nanny; and\nheaven does not approve. What are we to do!\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d Nanny detested weeping men. \u201cIt can\u2019t be as bad as all that. There isn\u2019t a sniff of low\nblood in Melena\u2019s veins. Whatever blight the child has will respond to Nanny\u2019s treatment. Trust\nNanny.\u201d\n\u201cI trusted in the Unnamed God,\u201d sobbed Frex.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always work at cross purposes, God and Nanny,\u201d said Nanny. She knew this was\nblasphemous, but she couldn\u2019t resist a gibe as long as Frex\u2019s resistance was down. \u201cBut don\u2019t\nworry, I won\u2019t breathe a word to Melena\u2019s family. We\u2019ll sort this all out in a flash, and no one need\nknow. The baby has a name?\u201d\n\u201cElphaba,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAfter Saint Aelphaba of the Waterfall?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cA fine old name. You\u2019ll use the common nickname Fabala, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWho even knows if she\u2019ll live long enough to grow into a nickname.\u201d Frex sounded as if he\nhoped this would be the case.\n\u201cInteresting country, are we in Wend Hardings yet?\u201d Nanny asked, to change the subject. But\nFrex had folded up inside, barely bothering to guide the horses onto the correct track. The country\nwas filthy, depressed, peasant-ridden; Nanny began to wish she had not set out in her best traveling\ngown. Roadside robbers might expect to find gold on such a refined-looking older woman, and they\nwould be right, for Nanny sported a golden garter stolen years ago from Her Ladyship\u2019s boudoir.\nWhat a humiliation, if the garter should turn up these years later on Nanny\u2019s well-turned if aging\nthigh! But Nanny\u2019s fears were unfounded, for the carriage arrived, without incident, in the yard of the\nminister\u2019s cottage.\n\u201cLet me see the baby first,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cIt will be easier and fairer on Melena if I know what\nwe\u2019re dealing with.\u201d And this wasn\u2019t hard to arrange, as Melena was out cold thanks to pinlobble\nleaves, while the baby in a basket on the table wailed softly.\nNanny drew up a chair so she wouldn\u2019t hurt herself if she fainted dead away. \u201cFrex, put the\nbasket on the floor where I can look into it.\u201d Frex obliged, and then went to return the horses and\ncarriage to Bree, who rarely needed them for mayoral duties but loaned them out to earn a little\npolitical capital.\nThe infant was wrapped in linens, Nanny saw, and the baby\u2019s mouth and ears were strapped\nwith a sling. The nose looked like a knob of bad mushroom, poking up for air, and the eyes were\nopen.\nNanny leaned closer. The child couldn\u2019t be, what, three weeks old? Yet as Nanny moved from\nside to side, looking at the profile of the forehead from this angle and that, so as to judge the shape of\nthe mind, the girl\u2019s eyes tracked her back and forth. They were brown and rich, the color of\noverturned earth, flecked with mica. There was a network of fragile red lines at each soft angle\nwhere the eyelids met, as if the girl had been bursting the blood threads from the exertion of\nwatching and understanding.\nAnd the skin, oh yes, the skin was green as sin. Not an ugly color, Nanny thought. Just not a\nhuman color.\nShe reached out and let her finger drift across the baby\u2019s cheek. The infant flinched, and her\nbackbone arched, and the wrapping, which was\ntucked securely around the child from neck to toe, split open like a husk. Nanny gritted her teeth\nand was determined not to be cowed. The baby had exposed herself sternum to groin, and the skin on\nher chest was the same remarkable color. \u201cHave you even touched this child yet, you two?\u201d\nmurmured Nanny. She put her hand palm down on the child\u2019s heaving chest, her fingers covering the\nalmost invisible baby nipples, then slid her hand down so she could check the apparatus below. The\nchild was wet and soiled but felt made according to standard design. The skin was the same miracle\nof pliant smoothness that Melena had possessed as an Infant.\n\u201cCome to Nanny, you horrid little thing you.\u201d Nanny leaned to pick the baby up, mess and all.\nThe baby swiveled to avoid the touch. Her head beat itself against the rush bottom of the basket.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dancing in the womb, I see,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cI wonder to whose music? Such welldeveloped muscles! No, you\u2019re not getting away from me. Come here, you little demon. Nanny\ndoesn\u2019t care. Nanny likes you.\u201d She was lying through her teeth, but unlike Frex she believed some\nlies were sanctioned by heaven.\nAnd she got her hands on Elphaba, and settled her on her lap. There Nanny waited, crooning\nand every now and then looking away, out the window, to recover herself and keep from vomiting.\nShe rubbed the baby\u2019s belly to calm the girl down, but there was no calming her down, not yet\n\n\fanyway.\nMelena propped herself up on her elbows in the late afternoon when Nanny brought a tray with\ntea and bread. \u201cI have made myself at home,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cand I\u2019ve made friends with your tiny\ndarling. Now come to your senses, sweetheart, and let me give you a kiss.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Nanny!\u201d Melena allowed herself to be coddled. \u201cThank you for coming. Have you seen the\nlittle monster?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s adorable,\u201d said Nanny.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie and don\u2019t be soft,\u201d said Melena. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to help you must be honest.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to help, you must be honest,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cWe need not go into it now, but I will\nhave to know everything, my sweet. So we can decide what\u2019s to be done.\u201d They sipped their tea, and\nbecause\nElphaba had fallen asleep at last, it seemed for a few moments like the old days at Colwen\nGrounds, when Melena would come home from afternoon walks with lithesome young gentry on the\nmake, and boast of their masculine beauty to a Nanny who pretended she had not noticed.\nIn fact, as the weeks went on, Nanny noticed quite a few disturbing things about the baby.\nFor one thing, Nanny tried to remove the baby\u2019s bandages, but Elphaba seemed intent on biting\nher own hands off, and the teeth inside that pretty, thin-lipped mouth were indeed monstrous. She\nwould bite a hole through the basket if she were left unfettered. She went after her own shoulder and\nscraped it raw. She looked as if she were strangling.\n\u201cCan\u2019t a barber be had to pull the teeth out?\u201d Nanny asked. \u201cAt least until the baby learns some\nself-control?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d Melena said. \u201cIt will be all over the valley that the little marrow is\ngreen. We\u2019ll keep the jaw strapped up until we solve the skin problem.\u201d\n\u201cHowever in the world did her skin come green?\u201d Nanny wondered, stupidly, for Melena\nblanched and Frex reddened, and the baby held her breath as if trying to turn blue to please them all.\nNanny had to slap her to make her breathe again.\nNanny interviewed Frex out in the yard. After the double blow of the birth and his public\nembarrassment, he was not yet up to professional engagements and sat whittling praying beads out of\noak, scoring and inscribing them with emblems of the Namelessness of God. Nanny set Elphaba\ndown inside-she had an unreasonable fear of being overheard by this infant, and, worse, of being\nunderstood-and Nanny sat scooping out a pumpkin for supper.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose, Frex, that you have green in your family background,\u201d she began, knowing full\nwell that Melena\u2019s powerful grandfather would have confirmed such a predisposition before\nagreeing to let his granddaughter marry a unionist minister-of all the chances she had!\n\u201cOur family isn\u2019t about money or about earthly power,\u201d said Frex, taking no offense for once.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m descended in a direct line from six ministers before me, father to son. We\u2019re as well\nregarded in spiritual circles as Melena\u2019s family is in parlors and at the court of Ozma. And no, there\nis no green, anywhere. I never heard of such a thing before in any family.\u201d\nNanny nodded and said, \u201cWell all right, I was only asking. I know you\u2019re gooden than goblin\nmartyrs.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Frex said humbly, \u201cNanny, I think I caused this thing to happen. My tongue slipped on the\nday of the birthday-I announced that the devil was coming. I meant the Clock of the Time Dragon. But\nsuppose those words unlocked room for the devil?\n\u201cThe child is no devil!\u201d snapped Nanny. She\u2019s no angel either, she thought, but kept it to\nherself.\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Frex continued, sounding more secure, \u201cshe may have been cursed by\nMelena, accidentally, who took my remark the wrong way and wept about it. Maybe Melena opened\n\n\fup inside herself a window through which an unattached sprite entered and colored the child.\u201d\n\u201cOn the very day she is to be born?\u201d said Nanny. \u201cThat\u2019s a capable sprite. Is your goodness so\nexalted you attract the truly high-powered among the Spirits of Aberration?\u201d\nFrex shrugged. A few weeks earlier he would have nodded, but his confidence was shattered\nwith his abject failure in Rush Margins. He did not dare suggest what he feared: The child\u2019s\nabnormality was a punishment for his failure to protect his flock from the pleasure faith.\n\u201cWell Nanny asked practically, \u201cif through a curse the goods were damaged, then through what\nmight the ill be overturned?\u201d\n\u201cAn exorcism,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cAre you empowered?\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m successful at changing her, we\u2019ll know that I\u2019m empowered,\u201d said Frex. But now that he\nhad a goal, his spirits brightened. He would spend some days in fasting, rehearsing prayers, and\ncollecting supplies for the arcane ritual.\nWhen he was off in the woods, and Elphaba napping, Nanny perched on the side of Melena\u2019s\nhard marriage mattress.\n\u201cFrex wonders if his prediction that the devil was coming caused a window in you to open,\nletting an imp pass through to spoil the baby,\u201d said Nanny. She was crocheting an edge of lace,\nclumsily; she had never excelled at piecework, but she liked handling the polished ivory crochet\nhook. \u201cI wonder if you opened another window?\u201d\nMelena, groggy from pinlobble leaves as usual, arched an eyebrow in confusion.\n\u201cDid you sleep with someone other than Frex?\u201d Nanny asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mad!\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cI know you, honey,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not a good wife. But when you had the\nboys buzzing around you in your parents\u2019 orchard you changed your perfumed undergarments more\nthan once a day. You were lusty and sneaky and good at it. I\u2019m not looking down at you. But don\u2019t\npretend to me that your appetites weren\u2019t healthy.\u201d\nMelena buried her face in the pillow. \u201cOh for those days!\u201d she wailed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love\nFrex! But I hate being better than the local peasant idiots!\u201d\n\u201cWell, now this green child brings you down to their level, you ought to be pleased,\u201d said\nNanny meanly.\n\u201cNanny, I love Frex. But he leaves me alone so often! I would kill for some tinker to pass by\nand sell me more than a tin coffeepot! I would pay well for someone less godly and more\nimaginative!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question for the future,\u201d said Nanny sensibly. \u201cI\u2019m asking you about the past. The\nrecent past. Since your marriage.\u201d\nBut Melena\u2019s face was vague and blurry. She nodded, she shrugged, she rocked her head.\n\u201cThe obvious theory is an elf,\u201d said Nanny.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have sex with an elf!\u201d Melena shrieked.\n\u201cNo more would I,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cbut the green does give one pause. Are there elves in the\nneighborhood?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gaggle of them, tree elves, up over the hill someplace, but if possible they are more\nmoronic than the fair citizens of Rush Margins. Really, Nanny, I\u2019ve never even seen one, or only\nfrom a distance. The idea is repulsive. Elves giggle at everything, do you know that? One of them\nfalls out of an oak and smashes his skull like a rotten turnip, and they gather and giggle and then\nforget about him. It\u2019s insulting of you even to bring it up.\u201d\n\u201cGet used to it, if we don\u2019t find a way out of this quagmire.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the answer is no.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cThen someone else. Someone handsome enough on the outside, but carrying a germ that maybe\nyou caught.\u201d\nMelena looked shocked. She hadn\u2019t thought of her own health since Elphaba was born. Could\nshe be at risk?\n\u201cThe truth,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cWe must know.\u201d\n\u201cThe truth,\u201d said Melena distantly. \u201cWell, it is unknowable.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to your question.\u201d And Melena explained. Yes, the cottage was off the\nbeaten track, and of course she never passed more than the curtest greetings with local farmers and\nfishermen and thickheads. But more travelers took to the hills and woods than you would credit.\nOften she had sat, listless and lonely, while Frex was off preaching, and she had found comfort in\ngiving passersby a simple meal and a buoyant conversation.\n\u201cAnd more?\u201d\nBut on those boring days, Melena muttered, she had taken to chewing pinlobble leaves. When\nshe would awake, because the sun was setting or Frex was there frowning or grinning at her, she\nremembered little.\n\u201cYou mean you indulged in adultery and you don\u2019t even have the benefit of a good saucy\nmemory about it?\u201d Nanny was scandalized.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I did!\u201d said Melena. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t choose to, I mean not if I was thinking\nclearly. But I remember once when a tinker with a funny accent gave me a draft of some heady brew\nfrom a green glass bottle. And I had rare expansive dreams, Nanny, of the Other World-cities of\nglass and smoke-noise and color-I tried to remember.\u201d\n\u201cSo you could well have been raped by elves. Won\u2019t your grandfather be pleased to learn how\nFrex is taking care of you.\u201d\n\u201cStop!\u201d cried Melena.\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to be done!\u201d Nanny lost her temper at last. \u201cEveryone\u2019s being\nirresponsible! If you can\u2019t remember whether your marriage vows have been broken or not, there\u2019s\nnot much good in acting like an offended saint.\u201d\n\u201cWe can always drown the baby and start over.\u201d\n\u201cJust try drowning that thing,\u201d muttered Nanny. \u201cI pity the poor lake asked to take her in.\u201d\nLater, Nanny went through Melena\u2019s small collection of medicines-herbs, drops, roots,\nbrandies, leaves. She was wondering, without much hope, if she could invent something that might\ncause the girl\u2019s skin to blanch. In the back of the chest Nanny found the green glass bottle spoken of\nby Melena. The light was bad and her eyes weren\u2019t strong, but she\ncould make out the words MIRACLE ELIXIR on a piece of paper pasted to the front.\nThough she had a native skill in healing, Nanny was unable to come up with a skin-changing\npotion. Bathing the child in cow\u2019s milk didn\u2019t make the skin white, either. But the child would not\nallow herself to be lowered into a pail of lake water; she twisted like a cat in panic. Nanny kept on\nwith the cow\u2019s milk. It left a horrid sour stink if she did not rub it off thoroughly with a cloth.\nFrex organized an exorcism. It involved candles and hymns. Nanny watched from a distance.\nThe man was beady-eyed, perspiring with effort even though the mornings were colder and colder.\nElphaba slept in her binding cloth in the middle of the carpet, oblivious to the sacrament.\nNothing happened. Frex fell, exhausted and spent, and cradled his green daughter within the\ncrook of his arm, as if finally embracing the proof of some undisclosed sin. Melena\u2019s face hardened.\nThere was only one thing left to try. Nanny gathered the courage to bring it up on the day she\nwas to leave back for Colwen Grounds.\n\u201cWe see that peasant treatments don\u2019t work,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cand spiritual intercession has failed.\n\n\fDo you have the courage to think about sorcery? Is there someone local who could magic the green\nvenom out of the child?\u201d\nFrex was up and lashing out at Nanny, swinging his fists. Nanny fell backward off her stool, and\nMelena bobbed about her, shrieking. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d cried Frex. \u201cIn this household! Isn\u2019t this green\ngirl insult enough? Sorcery is the refuge of the amoral; when it isn\u2019t out-and-out charlatanism, it is\ndangerously evil! Contracts with the demons!\u201d\nNanny said, \u201cOooh, preserve me! You fine, fine man, don\u2019t you know enough to fight fire with\nfire?\u201d\n\u201cNanny, enough,\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cHitting a feeble old woman,\u201d said Nanny, hurt. \u201cWho only tries to help.\u201d\nThe next morning Nanny packed her valise. There was nothing more that she could do, and she\nwasn\u2019t willing to live the rest of her life with a fanatical hermit and a ruined baby, even for the sake\nof Melena.\nFrex drove Nanny back to the inn at Stonespar End, for the coachand-four to take her home.\nNanny knew Melena might still think about\nkilling the child, but somehow she doubted it. Nanny held her valise to her ample bosom,\nfearing bandits again. Inside her valise was hidden her gold garter (she could always claim it had\nbeen planted there without her knowledge, whereas it would have been hard to claim it had been\nplanted on her leg in the same circumstances). She also had squirreled away the ivory crochet hook,\nthree of Frex\u2019s prayer beads because she liked the carvings, and the pretty green glass bottle left\nbehind by some itinerant salesman selling, apparently, dreams and passion and somnolence.\nShe didn\u2019t know what she thought. Was Elphaba devil\u2019s spawn? Was she half-elf? Was she\npunishment for her father\u2019s failure as a preacher, or for her mother\u2019s sloppy morals and bad\nmemory? Or was she merely a physical ailment, a blight like a misshapen apple or a five-legged\ncalf? Nanny knew her worldview was foggy and chaotic, pestered by demons, faith, and folk\nscience. It didn\u2019t escape her attention, however, that both Melena and Frex had believed\nuncompromisingly that they would have a boy. Frex was the seventh son of a seventh son, and to add\nto that powerful equation he was descended from six ministers in a row. VVhatever child of either\n(or any) sex could dare follow in so auspicious a line?\nPerhaps, thought Nanny, little green Elphaba chose her own sex, and her own color, and to hell\nwith her parents.\nFor one short, wet month, early in the next year, the drought lifted. Spring tipped in like green\nwell water, frothing at the hedges, bubbling at the roadside, splashing from the cottage roof in\ngarlands of ivy and stringflower. Melena went about the yard in a state of mild undress, so that she\ncould feel the sun on her pale skin and the deep warmth she had missed all winter. Strapped in her\nchair in the doorway, Elphaba, now a year and a half old, hit her breakfast minnow with the bowl of\nher spoon. \u201cOh, eat the thing, don\u2019t mash it,\u201d said Melena, but mildly. Since the child\u2019s chin-sling\nhad been removed, mother and daughter had begun to pay some attention to each other. To her\nsurprise, Melena sometimes found Elphaba endearing, the way a baby should be.\nThis view was the only thing she had seen since leaving the elegant mansion of her family, the\nonly thing she would ever gaze upon again- the windswept surface of Illswater, the distant dark stone\ncottages and chimneys of Rush Margins on the other side, the hills lying in a torpor beyond. She\nwould go mad; the world was nothing but water and want. If a frolic of elves scampered through the\nyard she would leap on them for company, for sex, for murder.\n\u201cYou father is a fraud,\u201d she said to Elphaba. \u201cOff finding himself all winter, leaving me with\nonly you for company. Eat that breakfast, for you\u2019ll get no more if you throw it on the ground.\u201d\nElphaba picked up the fish and threw it on the ground.\n\n\f\u201cYour father is a charlatan,\u201d continued Melena. \u201cHe used to be very good in bed for a religious\nman, and this is how I know his secret. Holy men are supposed to be above earthly pleasures, but\nyour father enjoyed his midnight wrestling. Once upon a time! We must never tell him we know he\u2019s\na humbug, it would break his heart. We don\u2019t want\nto break his heart, do we?\u201d And then Melena burst into a high peal of laughter.\nElphaba\u2019s face was unsmiling, unchanging. She pointed to the fish.\n\u201cBreakfast. Breakfast in the dirt. Breakfast for the bugs,\u201d Melena said. She dropped the collar\nof her spring robe a little lower and the pink yoke of her bare shoulders gyrated. \u201cShall we go walk\nby the edge of the lake today and maybe you\u2019ll drown?\u201d\nBut Elphaba would never drown, never, because she would not go near the lake.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll go out in a boat and tip over!\u201d Melena shrieked.\nElphaba cocked her head to one side as if listening for some part of her mother not intoxicated\nwith leaves and wine.\nThe sun swept out from behind a cloud. Elphaba scowled. Melena\u2019s robe dropped lower. Her\nbreasts worked their way out from between the dirty ruffles of the collar.\nLook at me, thought Melena, showing my breasts to the child I couldn\u2019t give milk to for fear of\namputation. I who was the rose of Nest Hardings, I who was the beauty of my generation! And now I\nam reduced to company I don\u2019t even want, my own squirming thorny little girl. She is more\ngrasshopper than girl, with those angular little thighs, those arching eyebrows, those poking fingers.\nShe\u2019s about the business of learning like any child, but she takes no delight in the world: She pushes\nand breaks and nibbles on things without any pleasure. As if she has a mission to taste and measure\nall the disappointments of life. In which Rush Margins is amply supplied. Mercy from the Unnamed\nGod, she\u2019s a creep, she is. She is.\n\u201cOr we might take a walk in the woods today and pick the last of the winter berries.\u201d Melena\nwas full of guilt at her lack of motherly feeling. \u201cWe can put them in a pie. Can we put them in a pie?\nShall we, honey?\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t speak yet, but she nodded, and began to wiggle to get down. Melena started a\nclapping game Elphaba took no notice of. The child grunted and pointed to the ground, and arched\nher long elegant legs to illustrate her desire. Then she gestured to the gate leading from the kitchen\ngarden and the hen yard.\nThere was a man at the uprights of the gate, leaning, shy and hungry-looking, with skin the color\nof roses at twilight: a dusky, shadowy red. He had a couple of leather satchels on his shoulders and\nback, and a\nwalking staff, and a dangerously handsome, hollow-looking face. Melena screeched and caught\nherself, directed her voice to a lower register. It had been so long since she had spoken to anyone but\na whining toddler. \u201cGood glory, you startled us!\u201d she cried. \u201cAre you searching for some breakfast?\u201d\nShe had lost the social touch. For instance, her breasts should not be staring at him so. Yet she did\nnot clasp her gown.\n\u201cPlease to forgive a sudden appearance by a strange foreigner at Lady\u2019s gate,\u201d said the man.\n\u201cForgiven, of course,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cCome in where I can see you-come in, come in!\u201d\nElphaba had seen so few other people in her life that she hid one eye behind her spoon, and\npeeked with the other eye.\nThe man approached. His movements showed the clumsiness of exhaustion. He was large of\nankle and thick of foot, slender about the waist and shoulders, and thick again in the neck-as if he had\nbeen made on a lathe, and worked too briefly at the extremities. His hands, letting down the satchels,\nseemed like beasts with minds of their own. They were outsized and splendid.\n\u201cTraveler not to know where he is,\u201d said the man. \u201cTwo nights to cross the hills from Downhill\n\n\fComings. To look for the inn at Three Dead Trees. To rest.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re lost, you\u2019ve veered,\u201d said Melena, deciding not to be perplexed at his scrambled\nwords. \u201cNo matter. Let me fix you a meal and you can tell me your story.\u201d Her hands were at her\nhair, which once used to be thought precious as spun brass. At least it was clean.\nThe man was sleek and fit. When he removed his cap his hair fell out in greasy hanks, sunset\nred. He washed at the pump, stripping off his shirt, and Melena noticed it was nice to see a waist on\na man again (Frex, bless him, had run to plumpness in the year-and-some since Elphaba\u2019s birth).\nWere all Quadlings this delicious dusty rose color? The man\u2019s name, Melena learned, was Turtle\nHeart, and he was a glassblower from Owels, in little-known Quadling Country.\nShe bundled up her breasts at last, reluctantly. Elphaba squawked to be let loose, and without\nso much as flinching the visitor unbuckled her and swept her in the air and caught her again. The\nchild crowed with surprise, even delight, and Turtle Heart repeated the trick. Melena took advantage\nof his concentration on the brat to scoop up the uneaten minnow from the dirt and rinse it off. She\nplopped it among the eggs and mashed tar root, hoping that Elphaba would not suddenly learn to\nspeak and embarrass her. It would be just like the child to do that.\nBut Elphaba was too charmed by this man to fuss or complain. She didn\u2019t even whine when\nTurtle Heart finally came to the bench and sat to eat. She crawled between his sleek, hairless calves\n(for he had shucked off his leggings) and she moaned some private tune with a satisfied smirk on her\nface. Melena found herself jealous of a female not yet two years old. She wouldn\u2019t have minded\nsitting on the ground between Turtle Heart\u2019s legs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met a Quadling before,\u201d she said, too loudly, too brightly. The months of solitude\nhad made hem forget hem manners. \u201cMy family would never have Quadlings in to dine-not that there\nwere many, or even any for all I know, in the farmlands around my family\u2019s estate. The stories make\nout that Quadlings were sneaky and incapable of telling the truth.\u201d\n\u201cHow can a Quadling to answer such a charge if a Quadling is given always to lie?\u201d He smiled\nat her.\nShe melted like butter on warm bread. \u201cI\u2019ll believe anything you say.\u201d He told her of the life in\nthe outreaches of Ovvels, the houses rotting gently into the swamp, the harvest of snails and\nmurkweed, the customs of communal living and ancestor worship. \u201cSo you believe your ancestors\nare with you?\u201d she prodded. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be nosy but I\u2019ve become interested in religion despite\nmyself.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Lady to believe ancestors are with her?\u201d\nShe could hardly focus on the question, so bright were his eyes, and so wonderful it was to be\ncalled Lady. Her shoulders straightened. \u201cMy immediate ancestors couldn\u2019t be farther away,\u201d she\nadmitted. \u201cI mean my parents- they\u2019re still living, but so uninteresting to me they might as well be\ndead.\u201d\n\u201cWhen dead they may to visit Lady often.\u201d\n\u201cThey are not welcome. Go away.\u201d She laughed, shooing. \u201cYou mean ghosts? They\u2019d better not.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d call the worst of both worlds-if there is an Other Land.\u201d\n\u201cThere is an otherworld,\u201d he said with certainty.\nShe felt chilled. She scooped Elphaba up and hugged her tightly. Elphaba sagged as if boneless\nin her arms, neither fussing nor returning the hug, just falling limp from the novelty of being touched.\n\u201cAre you a seer?\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cTurtle Heart to blow glass,\u201d he said. He seemed to mean that as an answer.\nMelena was suddenly reminded of the dreams she used to have, of exotic places she knew she\nwas too dull to invent. \u201cMarried to a minister, and I don\u2019t know that I believe in an otherworld,\u201d she\nadmitted. She hadn\u2019t meant to say that she was married, although she supposed the child implicated\n\n\fher.\nBut Turtle Heart had finished talking. He put down his plate (he had left the minnow) and he\ntook from his satchels a small pot, a pipe, and some sacks of sand and soda ash and lime and other\nminerals. \u201cMight Turtle Heart to thank Lady for her welcome?\u201d he asked; she nodded.\nHe built up the kitchen fire and sorted and mixed his ingredients, and arranged utensils, and\ncleaned the bowl of his pipe with a special rag folded in its own pouch. Elphaba sat clumplike, her\ngreen hands on her green toes, curiosity on her sharp pinched face.\nMelena had never seen glass blown, just as she had never seen paper made, cloth woven, or\nlogs hewn from tree trunks. It seemed as marvelous to her as the local stories of the traveling clock\nthat had hexed her husband into the professional paralysis from which he still hadn\u2019t quite escapedthough he tried.\nTurtle Heart hummed a note through his nose or the pipe as he blew an irregular bulb of hot\ngreenish ice. It steamed and hissed in the air. He knew what to do with it; he was a wizard of glass;\nMelena had to hold Elphaba back to keep her from burning her hands as she reached for it.\nIn what seemed like no time at all, in what felt like magic, the glass had gone from being\nsemiliquid and abstract to a hardening, cooling reality.\nIt was a smooth, impure circle, like a slightly oblong plate. All the while Turtle Heart worked\nwith it, Melena thought of her own character, going from youthful ether to hardening shell,\ntransparently empty. Breakable, too. But before she could lose herself in remorse, Turtle Heart took\nher two hands and passed them near, but not touching, the flat surface of the glass.\n\u201cLady to talk with ancestors,\u201d he said. But she would not struggle to connect with old boring\ndead people in the Other Land, not when his huge hands covered hers. She breathed through her nose\nto suppress the smell of breakfast in an unwashed mouth (fruit and one glass of wine, or was it\ntwo?). She thought she might well faint.\n\u201cLook in glass,\u201d he urged her. She could only look at his neck and his raspberry-honey-colored\nchin.\nHe looked for her. Elphaba came and steadied herself with a small hand on his knee and peered\nin, too.\n\u201cHusband Is near,\u201d said Turtle Heart. Was this prophecy through a glass dish or was he asking\nher a question? But he went on: \u201cHusband is traveling on a donkey and to bring elderly woman to\nvisit you. Is ancestor to visit?\u201d\n\u201cIs old nursemaid, probably,\u201d Melena said. She was sloping downward into his crippled\nsyntax, in unabashed sympathy. \u201cCan you really to see that in there?\u201d\nHe nodded. Elphaba nodded too, but at what?\n\u201cHow much time do we have before he gets here?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cTill this evening.\u201d\nThey did not speak another word until sunset. They banked the fire and hooked Elphaba to a\nharness, and sat her down in front of the cooling glass, which they hung on a string like a lens or a\nmirror. It seemed to mesmerize and calm her; she did not even gnaw absentmindedly at her wrists or\ntoes. They left the door to the cottage open so that, from time to time, they could peer out from the\nbed to check on the child who, in the glare of a sunny day, would not be able to focus her eyes to see\nin the house shadows, and who anyway never turned to look. Turtle Heart was unbearably beautiful.\nMelena dragon-snaked with him, covered him with her mouth, poured him in her hands, heated and\ncooled and shaped his luminosity. He filled her emptiness.\nThey were washed, and dressed, with supper mostly made, when the donkey brayed a half mile\ndown the lake. Melena blushed. Turtle Heart was back at the pipe, blowing again. Elphaba turned\nand looked in the direction of the donkey\u2019s serrated statement. Her lips, which always looked almost\n\n\fblack against the new-apple color of her skin, twisted tight, chewed against each other. She bit her\nlower lip as if thinking, but she did not bleed; she had learned to manage the teeth somewhat, through\ntrial and error. She put her hand on the shining disc. The glass circlet caught the last blue of the sky,\nuntil it looked like a magic mirror showing nothing but silver-cold water within.\nAll the way from Stonespar End, where Frex met her coach, Nanny complained. Lumbago,\nweak kidneys, fallen arches, aching gums, sore haunches. Frex wanted to say, And how about your\nswollen ego? Though he had been out of circulation for a while, he knew such a remark would be\nrude. Nanny flounced and petted herself, clinging determinedly to her seat until they arrived at the\nlodge near Rush Margins.\nMelena greeted Frex with affecting shyness. \u201cMy breastplate, my backbone,\u201d she murmured.\nShe was slender after a hard winter, her cheekbones more prominent. Her skin looked scoured as if\nby an artist\u2019s scratch brush-but she had always had the look of an etching-in-the-flesh. She was\nusually bold with her kisses and he found her reticence alarming until he realized there was a\nstranger in the shadows. Then, after introductions, Nanny and Melena fussed to get a meal on the\ntable, and Frex put out some oats for the sorry nag who had to pull the carriage. When this was done\nhe went to sit in the spring evening light and to meet his daughter again.\nElphaba was cautious around him. He found in his pouch a trinket he\u2019d whittled for her, a little\nsparrow with a cunning beak and upraised wings. \u201cLook, Fabala,\u201d he whispered (Melena hated the\nderivative, so he used it: it was his and Elphaba\u2019s private bond, the father-daughter pact against the\nworld). \u201cLook what I found in the forest. A little maplewood bird.\u201d\nThe child took the thing in her hands. She touched it softly, and put its head in her mouth. Frex\nsteeled himself to hear the inevitable splintering, and to hold back his sigh of disappointment. But\nElphaba did not bite. She sucked the head and looked at it again. Wet, it had greater life.\n\u201cYou like it,\u201d Frex said.\nShe nodded, and began to feel its wings. Now that she was distracted, Frex could draw her\nbetween his knees. He nuzzled his crinkly-bearded chin into her hair she smelled like soap and wood\nsmoke, and the char on toast, a good healthy smell-and he closed his eyes. It was good to be home.\nHe had spent the winter in an abandoned shepherd\u2019s hut on the windward slope of Griffon\u2019s\nHead. Praying and fasting, moving deeper inside and then further outside himself. And why not? At\nhome, he had felt the scorn of the people of the whole claustrophobic valley of Illswater; they had\nconnected the Time Dragon\u2019s slanderous story of a corrupt minister with the arrival of a deformed\nchild. They had drawn their own conclusions. They avoided his chapel services. So a sort of\nhermit\u2019s life, at least in small intervals, had seemed both penance and preparation for something\nelse, something next-but what?\nHe knew this life wasn\u2019t what Melena had originally expected, mar-tying him. With his\nbloodlines, Frex had looked primed for an elevation to proctor or even, eventually, bishop. He had\nimagined the happiness Melena would have as a society dame, presiding over feast day dinners and\ncharity balls and episcopal teas. Instead-he could see her in the firelight, grating a last, limp winter\ncarrot onto a pan of fish-here she wasted away, a partner in a difficult marriage on a cold, shadowy\nlakeshore. Frex had a notion that she wasn\u2019t sorry to see him go off from time to time, so that she\ncould be glad to see him come back.\nAs he ruminated, his beard tickled Elphaba\u2019s neck, and she snapped the wings off her wooden\nsparrow. She sucked on it like a whistle. Twisting away from him, she ran to a glass lens hanging\nfrom the projecting cave, and swatted at it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t, you\u2019ll break that!\u201d said her father.\n\u201cShe cannot to break that.\u201d The traveler, the Quadling, came from the sink where he had been\nwashing up.\n\n\f\u201cShe just turned her toy into a cripple,\u201d Frex said, pointing at the ruined bridling.\n\u201cShe is herself pleased at the half things,\u201d Turtle Heart said. \u201cI think. The little girl to play with\nthe broken pieces better.\u201d\nFrex didn\u2019t quite get it, but nodded. He knew that months away from the human voice made him\nclumsy at first. The boy from the inn,\nwho had climbed Griffon\u2019s Head to deliver Nanny\u2019s request to be picked up at Stonespar End,\nhad obviously thought Frex a wild man, grunting and unkempt. Frex had had to quote a little of the\nOzlad to indicate some sort of humanity-\u201cLand of green abandon, land of endless leaf\u201d-it was all that\nwould come to him.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t she break it?\u201d asked Frex.\n\u201cBecause I do not to make it to be broken,\u201d answered Turtle Heart. But he smiled at Frex, not\naggressively. And Elphaba wandered around with the shiny glass as if it were a toy, catching\nshadows, reflections, lights on its imperfect surface, almost as if she were playing.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked Frex, just as Turtle Heart was saying, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a Munchkinlander,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cI to think all Munchkins to be shorter than I or you.\u201d\n\u201cThe peasants, the farmers, yes,\u201d Frex said, \u201cbut anyone with bloodlines worth tracing married\ninto height somewhere along the way. And you? You\u2019re from Quadling Country.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Quadling. His reddish hair had been washed and was drying into an airy\nnimbus. Frex was glad to see Melena so generous as to offer a passerby water to bathe in. Perhaps\nshe was adjusting to country life after all. Because, mercy, a Quadling ranked about as low on the\nsocial ladder as it was possible to get and still be human.\n\u201cBut I to understand,\u201d said the Quadling. \u201cOvvels is a small world. Until I to leave, I am not to\nknow of hills, one beyond the other and from the spiny backbones a world so wide around. The\nblurry far away to hurt my eyes, for I cannot to make it seen. Please sir to describe the world you\nknow.\u201d\nFrex picked up a stick In the soil he drew an egg on its side. \u201cWhat they taught me in lessons,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cInside the circle is Oz. Make an\nhe did so, through the oval-\u201cand roughly speaking, you have a pie in four sections. The top Is\nGillikin Full of cities and universities and theatres, civilized life, they say. And industry.\u201d He moved\nclockwise. \u201cEast, is Munchkinland, where we are now. Farmland, the bread basket of Oz, except\ndown in the mountainous south-these strokes, in the district of Wend Hardings, are the hills you\u2019re\nclimbing.\u201d He bumped and squiggled. \u201cDirectly south of the center of Oz is Quadling Country.\nBadlands, I\u2019m\ntold\u2013marshy, useless, infested with bugs and feverish airs.\u201d Turtle Heart looked puzzled at this,\nbut nodded. \u201cThen west, what they call Winkie Country. Don\u2019t know much about that except it\u2019s dry\nand unpopulated.\u201d\n\u201cAnd around?\u201d said Turtle Heart.\n\u201cSandstone deserts north and west, fleckstone desert east and south. They used to say the desert\nsands were deadly poison; that\u2019s just standard propaganda. Keeps invaders from Ev and Quox from\ntrying to get in. Munchkinland is rich and desirable farming territory, and Gillikin\u2019s not bad either. In\nthe Glikkus, up here\u201d-he scratched lines in the northeast, on the border between Gillikin and\nMunchkinland-\u201care the emerald mines and the famous Glikkus canals. I gather there\u2019s a dispute\nwhether the Glikkus is Munchkinlander or Gillikinese, but I have no opinion on that.\u201d\nTurtle Heart moved his hands over the drawing in the dirt, flexing his palms, as if he were\nreading the map from above. \u201cBut here?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is here?\u201d\nFrex wondered if he meant the air above Oz. \u201cThe realm of the Unnamed God?\u201d he said. \u201cThe\n\n\fOther Land? Are you a unionist?\u201d\n\u201cTurtle Heart is glassblower,\u201d said Turtle Heart.\n\u201cI mean religiously.\u201d\nTurtle Heart bowed his head and didn\u2019t meet Frex\u2019s eye. \u201cTurtle Heart is not to know what\nname to call this.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about Quadlings,\u201d said Frex, warming to a possible convert. \u201cBut Gillikinese and\nMunchkinlanders are largely unionist. Since Lurlinist paganism went out. For centuries, there have\nbeen unionist shrines and chapels all over Oz. Are there none in Quadling Country?\u201d\n\u201cTurtle Heart does not to recognize what is this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd now respectable unionists are going in droves over to the pleasure faith,\u201d said Frex,\nsnorting, \u201cor even tiktokism, which hardly even qualifies as a religion. To the ignorant everything is\nspectacle these days. The ancient unionist monks and aunts knew their place in the universeacknowledging the life source too sublime to be named-and now we sniff up the skirts of every musty\nmagician who comes along. Hedonists, anarchists, solipsists! Individual freedom and amusement is\nall! As if sorcery had any moral component! Charms, alley magic, industrial-strength sound and light\ndisplays, fake shape-changers! Charlatans, nabobs of necromancy, chemical and herbal wisdoms,\nhumbug hedonists!\nSelling their bog recipes and crone aphorisms and schoolboy spells! It makes me sick.\u201d\nTurtle Heart said, \u201cShall Turtle Heart to bring you water, shall Turtle Heart to lie you down?\u201d\nHe put fingers soft as calfskin on the side of Frex\u2019s neck. Frex shivered and realized he had been\nshouting. Nanny and Melena were standing in the doorway with the pan of fish, silent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech, I\u2019m not sick,\u201d he said, but he was touched at the concern the foreigner\nhad shown. \u201cI think we\u2019ll eat.\u201d\nAnd they did. Elphaba ignored her food except to prod the eyes out of the baked fish and to try\nto fit them onto her wingless bird. Nanny grumbled good-naturedly about the wind off the lake, her\nchills, her backbone, her digestion. Her gas was apparent from more than a few feet away and Frex\nmoved, as discreetly as possible, to be upwind. He found himself sitting next to the Quadling on the\nbench.\n\u201cSo is all that clear to you?\u201d Frex pointed a fork at the map of Oz.\n\u201cIs Emerald City to be where?\u201d said the Quadling, fish bones poking out from between his lips.\n\u201cDead center,\u201d Frex said.\n\u201cAnd there is Ozma,\u201d said Turtle Heart.\n\u201cOzma, the ordained Queen of Oz, or so they say,\u201d Frex said, \u201cthough the Unnamed God must be\nruler of all, in our hearts.\u201d\n\u201cHow can unnamed creature to rule-\u201d began Turtle Heart.\n\u201cNo theology at dinner,\u201d sang out Melena, \u201cthat\u2019s a house rule dating from the start of our\nmarriage, Turtle Heart, and we obey it.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, I still harbor a devotion to Lurline.\u201d Nanny made a face in Frex\u2019s direction. \u201cOld\nfolks like me are allowed to. Do you know about Lurline, stranger?\u201d\nTurtle Heart shook his head.\n\u201cIf we have no theology then we surely have no arrant pagan nonsense-\u201d began Frex, but Nanny,\nbeing a guest and invoking a touch of deafness when it suited her, plowed on.\n\u201cLurline is the Fairy Queen who flew over the sandy wastes, and spotted the green and lovely\nland of Oz below. She left her daughter Ozma to rule the country in her absence and she promised to\nreturn to Oz in its darkest hour.\u201d\n\u201cHah!\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cNo hahs at me.\u201d Nanny sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m as entitled to my beliefs as you are, Frexspar the Godly.\n\n\fAt least they don\u2019t get me into trouble as yours do.\u201d\n\u201cNanny, govern your temper,\u201d said Melena, enjoying this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Frex. \u201cOzma rules in the Emerald City, and anyone who\u2019s seen her, or\npaintings of her, knows that she\u2019s from Gillikinese stock. She\u2019s got the same broad band of forehead,\nthe slightly gapped front teeth, the frenzy of curling blond hair, the quick shifts of mood- usually into\nanger. All characteristic of Gillikinese peoples. You\u2019ve seen her, Melena, tell him.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she is elegant in her way,\u201d Melena admitted.\n\u201cThe daughter of a Fairy Queen?\u201d said Turtle Heart.\n\u201cMore nonsense,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cNot nonsense!\u201d snapped Nanny.\n\u201cThey think she bears herself again and again like a phoenix,\u201d said Frex. \u201cHah and double hah.\nThere\u2019ve been three hundred years of very different Ozmas. Ozma the Mendacious was a dedicated\naunt, who lowered rulings in a bucket down from the topmost chamber in a cloister tower. She was\nas mad as a bung beetle. Ozma the Warrior conquered the Glikkus, at least for a time, and\ncommandeered the emeralds with which to decorate the Emerald City. Ozma the librarian did\nnothing but read genealogies for her whole life long. Then there was Ozma the Scarcely Beloved,\nwho kept pet ermines. She overtaxed the farmers to begin the road system of yellow brick that\nthey\u2019re still struggling to complete, and much luck to them, I say.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Ozma now?\u201d asked Turtle Heart.\n\u201cActually,\u201d said Melena, \u201cI had the pleasure to meet the last Ozma at a social season in the\nEmerald City-my grandfather the Eminent Thropp had a town house. The winter I was fifteen I was\nbrought out into society there. She was Ozma the Bilious, because of a bad stomach. She was the size\nof a lake narwhal, but she dressed beautifully. I saw her with her husband, Pastorius, at the Oz\nFestival of Song and Sentiment.\u201d\n\u201cShe is no longer the Queen?\u201d asked Turtle Heart, confused.\n\u201cShe died in an unfortunate accident involving some rat poison,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cDied,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cor her spirit moved next into her child, Ozma Tippetarius.\u201d\n\u201cThe current Ozma is just about the age of Elphaba,\u201d said Melena, \u201cso her father, Pastorius, is\nthe Ozma Regent. The good man will rule until Ozma Tippetarius is old enough to take the throne.\u201d\nTurtle Heart shook his head. Frex was annoyed because they had spent so much time talking\nabout the worldly ruler and ignored the eternal realm, and Nanny lapsed into a bout of indigestion for\nwhich they all were very sorry, olfactorily speaking.\nAnyway, even being irritated, Frex was glad to be home. Because of the beauty of Melena-she\nwas almost glowing tonight as the sun left the sky-and because of the surprise of Turtle Heart,\nsmiling and un-self-conscious next to him. Maybe because of Turtle Heart\u2019s religious emptiness,\nwhich Frex found challenging and appealing, almost tempting.\n\u201cThen there\u2019s the dragon beneath Oz, in a hidden cavern,\u201d Nanny was saying to Turtle Heart.\n\u201cThe dragon who has dreamt the world, and who will burn it in flames when he awakes-\u201c\n\u201cShut up that superstitious codswallop!\u201d shouted Frex.\nElphaba, on all fours, advanced on the uneven planks of the flooring. She bared her teeth-as if\nshe knew what a dragon was, as if she were pretending-and roared. Her green skin made her more\npersuasive, as if she were a dragon child. She roared again-\u201cOh sweetheart, don\u2019t,\u201d said Frex-and\nshe peed on the floor, and sniffed her urine with satisfaction and disgust.\nOne afternoon toward the end of summer, Nanny said, \u201cThere\u2019s a beast abroad. I\u2019ve seen it at\ndusk several times, lurking about in the ferns. What sorts of creatures are native to these hills\nanyway?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find anything larger than a gopher,\u201d said Melena. They were at the side of the brook,\n\n\fworking at laundry. The small spring wetness had long since ceased, and the drought had clamped its\nhand down again. The stream was only a thin trickle. Elphaba, who would not come near the water,\nwas stripping a wild pear tree of its stunted crop. She clung to the trunk with her hands and outturned feet, and threw her head around, catching the sour fruit with her teeth and then spitting seeds\nand stem on the ground.\n\u201cThis is larger than a gopher,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cTrust me. Have you bears? It could have been a\nbear cub, though it moved mighty fast.\u201d\n\u201cNo bears. There\u2019s the rumor of rock tigers on the felltop, but they tell me not a single one has\nbeen sighted in ages. And rock tigers are notoriously skittish and shy. They don\u2019t come near human\ndwellings.\u201d\n\u201cA wolf then? Are there wolves?\u201d Nanny let the sheet droop in the water. \u201cIt could have been a\nwolf.\u201d\n\u201cNanny, you think you\u2019re in the desert. Wend Hardings is desolate, I agree, but it\u2019s a tame\nbarrenness for all that. You\u2019re alarming me with your wolf and your tiger talk.\u201d\nElphaba, who would not speak yet, made a low growl in the pocket of her throat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cLet\u2019s finish up and dry these things back at the house. Enough is\nenough. Besides, I have other things I want to say to you. Let\u2019s give the child to Turtle Heart and\nlet\u2019s go off somewhere.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cSomewhere safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you have to say you can say within earshot of Elphaba,\u201d said Melena. \u201cYou know she\ndoesn\u2019t understand a word.\u201d\n\u201cYou confuse not speaking with not listening,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cI think she understands plenty.\u201d\n\u201cLook, she\u2019s smearing fruit on her neck, like a cologne-\u201c\n\u201cLike a war paint, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cOh, dour Nanny, stop being such a goose and scrub those sheets harder. They\u2019re filthy.\u201d\n\u201cI need hardly ask whose sweat and leakage this is .\n\u201cOh you, no you needn\u2019t ask, but don\u2019t start moralizing at me-\u201c\n\u201cBut you know Frex is bound to notice sooner or later. These energetic afternoon naps you takewell, you always had an eye for the fellow with a decent helping of sausage and hard-boiled eggs-\u201c\n\u201cNanny, come, this is none of your affair.\u201d\n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity,\u201d said Nanny, sighing. \u201cIsn\u2019t aging a cruel hoax? I\u2019d trade my hard-won pearls\nof wisdom for a good romp with Uncle Flagpole any day.\u201d\nMelena flipped a handful of water in Nanny\u2019s face to shut her up. The older woman blinked and\nshe said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s your garden, plant there what you choose and reap what you may. What I want to\ntalk about is the child, anyway.\u201d\nThe girl was now squatting behind the pear tree, eyes narrowed at something in the distance.\nShe looked, thought Melena, like a sphinx, like a stone beast. A fly even landed on her face and\nwalked across the bridge of her nose, and the child didn\u2019t flinch or squirm. Then, suddenly, she\nleaped and pounced, a naked green kitten after an invisible butterfly.\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\u201cMelena, she needs to get used to other children. She\u2019ll start talking a little bit if she sees that\nother chicks are talking.\u201d\n\u201cTalking among children is an overrated concept.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be glib. You know she needs to get used to people other than us. She\u2019s not going to have\nan easy time of it anyhow, unless she sheds her greeny skin as she grows up. She needs the habits of\nconversation. Look, I give her chores to do, I warble nursery rhymes at her. Melena, why doesn\u2019t she\nrespond like other children?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s boring. Some children just are.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cShe ought to have other pups to play with. They would infect her with a sense of fun.\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, Frex doesn\u2019t expect a child of his to be interested in fun,\u201d said Melena. \u201cFun is\ncounted for overmuch in this world, Nanny. I agree with him on that.\u201d\n\u201cSo your dragon-snaking with Turtle Heart is what-devotional exercises?\u201d\n\u201cI said don\u2019t be catty, please!\u201d Melena focused on the toweling, beating it with annoyance.\nNanny would go on about this; she was up to something. And Nanny had hit the nail on the head.\nThere crept Turtle Heart into the cool shadows of the cottage, when Melena was tired from a\nmorning\u2019s work in the vegetable garden. He covered her with a sense of holiness, and it was more\nthan her undergarments that would drop away from her when they tumbled panting onto the\nbedclothes. She would lose her sense of shame.\nShe knew this did not follow conventional reason. Nevertheless, should a tribunal of unionist\nministers call her to court for adultery, she would tell the truth. Somehow Turtle Heart had saved her\nand restored her sense of grace, of hope in the world. Her belief in the goodness of things had been\ndashed into bits when little green Elphaba crawled into being. The child was extravagant punishment\nfor a sin so minor she didn\u2019t even know if she had committed it.\nIt was not the sex that saved her, though the sex was mighty vigorous, even frightening. It was\nthat Turtle Heart didn\u2019t blush when Frex showed up, that he didn\u2019t shrink from beastly little Elphaba.\nHe set up shop in the side yard, blowing glass and grinding it, as if life had brought him here just to\nredeem Melena. Wherever else he might have been heading had been forgotten.\n\u201cVery well, you old interfering cow,\u201d said Melena. \u201cFor the sake of argument, what do you\npropose?\u201d\n\u201cWe must take Elphie to Rush Margins and find some small children for her to play with.\u201d\nMelena sat back on her haunches. \u201cBut you have to be jesting!\u201d she cried. \u201cSlow and deliberate\nas Elphaba is, at least she\u2019s unharmed here! I may not be able to summon much maternal warmth, but\nI feed her, Nanny, and I keep her from hurting herself! How cruel, to inflict the outside world on her! A green child will be an open invitation for scorn and abuse. And children\nare wickeder than adults, they have no sense of restraint. We might as well go throw her in the lake\nshe\u2019s so terrified of.\u201d\n\u201cNo no no,\u201d said Nanny, putting her fat hands on her own knees; her voice was thick with\ndetermination. \u201cNow I am going to argue with you about this, Melena, until you give in. Time in its\nwisdom will bring you around to my way of thinking. Listen to me. Listen to me. You are only a\npampered little rich girl who flitted about from music lessons to dance lessons with neighborhood\nchildren equally rich and stupid as you. Of course there\u2019s cruelty. But Elphaba must learn who she is\nand she must face down cruelty early. And there will be less of it than you expect.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t play Nanny Goddess with me. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cNanny is not giving up,\u201d said Nanny, just as fiercely. \u201cI have a long-range view of your\nhappiness as well as hers, and believe me, if you don\u2019t give her the weapons and armor with which\nshe can defend herself against scorn, she\u2019ll make your life miserable as hers will be miserable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the weapons and armor she\u2019ll learn from the dirty urchins of Rush Margins?\u201d\n\u201cLaughter. Fun. Teasing. Smiling.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not above blackmailing you about this, Melena said Nanny. \u201cI can wander into Rush\nMargins this afternoon and find where Frex is trying to hold his revival meeting and whisper a few\nwords to him. While Frex is busy cranking up the religious ardor of Rush Margins sluggards, would\nhe be interested in knowing what his wife is up to with Turtle Heart?\u201d\n\u201cYou are a miserable old fiend! You are a foul, unethical bully!\u201d cried Melena.\nNanny grinned with pride. \u201cNo later than tomorrow,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll go in tomorrow and get\n\n\fher life started.\u201d\nIn the morning a stiff, unforgiving wind galloped from the heights. It picked up old leaves and\nthe remains of failed crops and kitchen gardens. Nanny pulled a shawl across her rounded shoulders\nand tugged a bonnet over her brow. Her eyes were full of marginal beasts; she kept turning to see a\nslinking cat-thing or a vixen dissolve into clots of skeleton leaves and debris.\nNanny found a blackthorn staff as if to aid her over stones and ruts, but she hoped to be ready to\nwield it against some hungry beast. \u201cThe land is dry and cold,\u201d she observed, almost to herself.\n\u201cAnd so little rain! Of course the big beasts would be driven from the hills. Let\u2019s walk together, no\nrunning ahead, little green.\u201d\nThey made their way in silence: Nanny fearful, Melena angry at having to miss her afternoon\ndalliance, and Elphaba like a windup toy, one foot solidly in front of the other. The margins of the\nlake had receded, and some of the crude docks were now walkways over pebble and drying\ngreenrot, with the water pulled back beyond their reach.\nGawnette\u2019s was a dark stone cottage with a roof of moldering thatch. Because of a bad hip,\nGawnette was no good at hauling the fishing nets or at kneeling over the wasting vegetable gardens.\nShe had a mess of small children in various stages of undress, squawling and sulking and trotting\naround the dirty yard in a little pack. She looked up as the minister\u2019s family approached.\n\u201cGood day, and you must be Gawnette,\u201d said Nanny brightly. She was pleased to open the gate\nand be safely inside the garden, even of this hovel. \u201cBrother Frexspar told us we would find you\nhere.\u201d\n\u201cSweet Lurline, what they say is true!\u201d said Gawnette, making a holy sign against Elphaba. \u201cI\nthought it vicious lies, and here she is!\u201d\nThe children had slowed to a walk. They were boys and girls, brown-faced and white, all of\nthem filthy, all of them keen on something new. Though they kept walking, playing some game of\nendurance or make-believe, their eyes never left Elphaba.\n\u201cYou know this is Melena-of course you do-and I am their Nanny,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased\nto meet you, Gawnette.\u201d She slid a glance at Melena and bit her upper lip and nodded.\n\u201cVery pleased, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Melena stonily.\n\u201cAnd we need some advice, for you come well recommended,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cThe little girl has\nproblems, and the best of our thinking just doesn\u2019t seem to bring forth any good ideas.\u201d\nGawnette leaned forward, suspicious.\n\u201cThe child is green,\u201d whispered Nanny confidentially. \u201cYou may not have noticed, being\nattracted by her charm and warmth. Of course, we know the good people of Rush Margins wouldn\u2019t\nlet a thing like that\nbother them. But because she is green, she is shy. Look at her. Little frightened spring turtle. We\nneed to draw her out, make her happier, and we don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s green all right,\u201d said Gawnette. \u201cNo wonder useless Brother Frexspar retired from his\npreaching for so long!\u201d She threw back her head and laughed raucously, unkindly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s only\nnow had the nerve to take it up again! Well, that\u2019s balls if ever I heard it!\u201d\n\u201cBrother Frexspar,\u201d interrupted Melena coldly, \u201creminds us of the scriptures-\u2019No one knows\nthe color of a soul.\u2019 Gawnette, he suggested I remind you of that very text.\u201d\n\u201cDid he now,\u201d mumbled Gawnette, chastised. \u201cWell then, what do you want with me?\u201d\n\u201cLet her play, let her learn, let her come here and be minded by you. You know more than we\ndo,\u201d said Nanny.\nThe cunning old cow, thought Melena. She is trying that rarest of strategies, telling the truth, and\nmaking it sound plausible. They sat down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019d take to her,\u201d said Gawnette, holding out a while. \u201cAnd you know my hip\n\n\fdoesn\u2019t let me hop up and stop them when they get going.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. And of course there\u2019d be some payment, some cash, Melena fully agrees,\u201d said\nNanny. The barren vegetable plot had caught her attention. This was poverty. Nanny gave Elphaba a\npush. \u201cWell, go on in, child, and see what\u2019s what.\u201d\nThe girl didn\u2019t budge, didn\u2019t blink. The children came near to her. There were five boys and\ntwo girls. \u201cWhat an ugly pug,\u201d said one of the older boys. He touched Elphaba on the shoulder.\n\u201cPlay nicely now,\u201d said Melena, about to leap up, but Nanny kept her hand out to say, Stay\ndown.\n\u201cTag, let\u2019s tag,\u201d said the boy, \u201cwho\u2019s the greenily?\u201d\n\u201cNot it, not it!\u201d The other children shrieked, and rushed in to\nbrush Elphaba with their hands, and then raced away. She stood for a\nminute, unsure, her own hands down and clenched, and then she ran a\nfew steps, and stopped.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way, healthful exercise,\u201d said Nanny, nodding. \u201cGawnette, you\u2019re a genius.\u201d\n\u201cI know my chicks,\u201d said Gawnette. \u201cDon\u2019t say I don\u2019t.\u201d\nHerdlike, the children rushed in again, tapping and darting away, but the girl would not chase\nthem. So they neared her once more.\n\u201cIs it true you got a Quadling muckfrog staying with you too?\u201d said Gawnette. \u201cIs it true he only\neats grass and dung?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d cried Melena.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they say, is it true?\u201d said Gawnette.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fine man.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a Quadling?\u201d\n\u201cNell-yes.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring him around here then, they spread the plague,\u201d said Gawnette.\n\u201cThey spread no such thing,\u201d snapped Melena.\n\u201cNo throwing, Elphie dear,\u201d called Nanny.\n\u201cI\u2019m only saying what I hear. They say at night that Quadlings fall asleep and their souls climb\nout through their mouths and go abroad.\u201d\n\u201cStupid people say a lot of stupid things.\u201d Melena was curt and too loud. \u201cI have never seen his\nsoul climb out of his mouth while he was sleeping, and I\u2019ve had plenty of opportunity\u201d\n\u201cDarling, no rocks,\u201d shrilled Nanny. \u201cNone of the other children have rocks.\u201d\n\u201cNow they do,\u201d observed Gawnette.\n\u201cHe is the most sensitive person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cSensitive isn\u2019t much use to a fishwife,\u201d said Gawnette. \u201cHow about to a minister and a\nminister\u2019s wife?\u201d\n\u201cNow there\u2019s blood, how vexing,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cChildren, let Elphie up so I can wipe that cut.\nAnd I didn\u2019t bring a rag. Gawnette?\u201d\n\u201cBleeding is good for them, makes them less hungry,\u201d said Gawnette.\n\u201cI rate sensitive a good sight higher than stupid,\u201d said Melena, seething.\n\u201cNo biting,\u201d said Gawnette to one of the little boys, and then, seeing Elphaba open her mouth to\nretaliate, raised herself to her feet, bad hip or no, and screamed, \u201cno biting, for the love of mercy!\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t children divine?\u201d said Nanny.\nEvery\nsecond or third day Nanny took Elphaba by the hand and waddled the shadowy road to Rush\nMargins. There Elphaba mingled with the greasy children under the eyes of sullen Gawnette. Frex\nhad moved out again (was it confidence or desperation?)-he was scaring miserable hamlets with his\n\n\ffrenzied beard and his collected opinions on faith. Gone for eight, ten days at a time. Melena\npracticed piano arpeggios on a tuneless mock keyboard Frex had carved for her, to perfect scale.\nTurtle Heart seemed to wilt and parch as autumn came on. Their afternoons of dalliance began\nto lose the heat of urgency, and developed in warmth. Melena had always appreciated the attentions\nof Frex, and been attentive to him, but somehow his body had not been as supple as Turtle Heart\u2019s.\nShe drifted off to sleep with Turtle Heart\u2019s mouth on one of her nipples and his hands-his big handsroaming like sentient pets. She imagined that Turtle Heart divided his body when her eyes were\nclosed; his mouth roamed, his cock rose and nudged and leaned, his breath was somewhere other\nthan his mouth, hissing elegantly into her ear, wordlessly, his arms were like stirrups.\nStill she didn\u2019t know him, not the way she knew Frex; she could not see through him as she\ncould most people. She put this down to his majestic bearing, but Nanny, ever watchful, remarked\none evening that it was just that his ways were the ways of a Quadling and Melena had never even\nacknowledged that he came from a different culture than she did.\n\u201cCulture, what\u2019s culture,\u201d Melena said lazily. \u201cPeople are people.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember your nursery rhymes?\u201d Nanny put aside her sewing (with relief) and\nrecited.\n\u201cBoys study, girls know,\nThat\u2019s the way that lessons go.\nBoys learn, girls forget,\nThat\u2019s the way of lessons yet.\nGillikinese are sharp as knives,\nMunchkinlanders lead corny lives,\nGlikkuns beat their ugly wives,\nWinkies swarm in sticky hives.\nBut the Quadlings, Oh the Quadlings,\nSlimy stupid curse-at-godlings,\nEat their young and bury their old\nA day before their bodies get cold.\nGive me an apple and I\u2019ll say it again.\n- \u201cWhat do you know of him?\u201d Nanny asked. \u201cIs he married? Why did he leave Lower Slimepit\nor wherever he comes from? Naturally, it\u2019s not my place to ask such personal questions-\u201c\n\u201cSince when did you ever know your place or keep it, either?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Nanny leaves her place, believe me, you\u2019ll know,\u201d said Nanny.\nOne evening in early autumn, for fun they built up a fire in the yard. Frex was home and goodhumored, and Nanny was thinking of heading back to Colwen Grounds, which made Melena goodhumored too. Turtle Heart put together a supper, a distasteful goulash of small sour new apples and\ncheese and bacon.\nFrex was feeling expansive. The effect of that blasted tiktok contrivance, the Clock of the Time\nDragon, had been wearing off at last- thank the Unnamed God-and the graceless poor had been\nturning out to hear Frex harangue them. A two-week mission at Three Dead Trees had been a\nsuccess. Frex had been rewarded with a small wallet of brass coins and barter tokens, and the glow\nof devotion or even lust on the face of more than one penitent.\n\u201cPerhaps our time here is limited,\u201d said Frex, sighing with contentment and clasping his arms\nbehind his head-the typical male response to happiness, thought Melena: to predict its demise. Her\nhusband went\non. \u201cPerhaps the road from Rush Margins leads us on to higher things, Melena. Grander stations\nin life.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh please,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family rose from humble beginnings for nine generations, to\nproduce me with my ankles in the mud out here in the middle of nowhere. I don\u2019t believe in higher\nthings.\u201d\n\u201cI mean the lofty ambitions of the spirit. I don\u2019t mean to storm the Emerald City and become\npersonal confessor to the Ozma Regent.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not put yourself forward to be confessor to Ozma Tippetarius?\u201d Nanny asked. She could\nsee herself rising in courtly Emerald City society if Frex had such a position. \u201cSo what if the royal\nbaby is only, what, two years old? Three? So we have government by a male regent again. It\u2019s only\nfor a limited engagement-like most male encounters. You\u2019re young still-she\u2019ll grow up-you\u2019ll be\nwell-placed to influence policy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about ministering to anyone in court, not even an Ozma the Fanatically Devout.\u201d\nFrex lit a sallowwood pipe. \u201cMy mission is to the downtrodden and humble.\u201d\n\u201cGoodness should to travel to Quadling Country,\u201d said Turtle Heart. \u201cDowntrodden there.\u201d\nTurtle Heart didn\u2019t often speak of his past, and Melena remembered Nanny\u2019s gibe about her\nlack of curiosity. She waved the pipe smoke away and said, \u201cWhy did you leave Ovvels anyway?\u201d\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d he said.\nElphaba, who had been hoping for ants to crawl across the grinding stone so she could mash\nthem with a rock, looked up across the shallow basin of the stone. The others waited for Turtle Heart\nto go on. Melena\u2019s heart lifted uneasily-she had a sudden premonition of things changing right here,\nthis very evening, this most splendid gentle night, things going awry just when they had managed to\nsettle down.\n\u201cWhat sort of horrors?\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cI feel a chill. I\u2019ll get a shawl,\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cOr minister to Pastorius! The Ozma Regent! Why not, Frex?\u201d Nanny said. \u201cI\u2019m sure with\nMelena\u2019s family connections you could twist an invitation-\u201c\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d said Elphaba.\nIt was her first word, and it was greeted with silence. Even the\nmoon, a lambent bowl among the trees, seemed to pause.\n\u201cHorrors?\u201d Elphaba said again, looking around. Though her mouth was serious, her eyes\nglowed; she had realized her own accomplishment. She was nearly two years old. The big sharp\nteeth in her mouth could not keep her words locked inside her anymore. \u201cHorrors,\u201d she tried in a\nwhisper. \u201cHorrors.\u201d\n\u201cCome to Nanny, darling. Come sit on my lap and hush for a while.\u201d\nShe obeyed, but sat forward, apart from Nanny\u2019s cushiony bosom, allowing Nanny\u2019s arms to\nring around her waist but no contact more than that. She stared at Turtle Heart and waited.\nAnd Turtle Heart said in an awed voice, \u201cTurtle Heart is thinking the child to speak for the first\ntime.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Frex, exhaling a ring of smoke, \u201cand she\u2019s asking about the horrors. Unless you\ndon\u2019t care to tell\n\u201cTurtle Heart to say little. Turtle Heart to work in glass, and to leave words for the Goodness\nand the Lady and the Nanny. And now for the Girl.\u201d\n\u201cSay a little, though. Since you brought it up.\u201d\nMelena shivered; she hadn\u2019t gone for the shawl. She could not move. She was heavy as stone.\n\u201cWorkers from the Emerald City and other places, they to come to Quadling Country. They to\nlook and taste and sample the air, the water, the soil. They to plan the highway. Quadlings to know\nthis is wasted tune and wasted effort. They do not to listen to Quadling voices.\u201d\n\u201cQuadlings aren\u2019t road engineers, I suspect,\u201d said Frex evenly.\n\n\f\u201cThe country is delicate,\u201d said Turtle Heart. \u201cIn Ovvels the houses to float between trees.\nCrops to grow on small platforms hooked by ropes. Boys to dive in shallow water for vegetable\npearls. Too many trees and there is not enough light for crops and health. Too few trees and the\nwater rises and roots of plants floating on top cannot to stretch to soil. QuadlIng Country is poor\ncountry but beauty rich. It only to support life by careful planning and cooperation.\u201d\n\u201cSo resistance to the Yellow Brick Road-\u201c\n\u201cIs only part of the story. Quadlings cannot to convince road builders, who want to build up\ndikes of mud and stone and to cut Quadling Country in pieces. Quadlings to argue, and to pray, and to\ntestify, and cannot to win with words.\u201d\nFrex held his pipe in his two hands and watched Turtle Heart speak. Frex was drawn to him;\nFrex was always drawn to intensity.\n\u201cQuadlings consider to fight,\u201d said Turtle Heart. \u201cBecause they think this is only the start. When\nthe builders to test soil and to sift water, they to learn of things Quadlings are smart for ever, but\nQuadlings to keep still.\u201d\n\u201cThings you know?\u201d\n\u201cTurtle Heart to speak of rubies,\u201d he said with a great sigh. \u201cRubies under the water. Red as\npigeon blood. Engineers to say: Red corundum in bands of crystalline limestone under swamp.\nQuadlings to say: The blood of Oz.\u201d\n\u201cLike the red glass you make?\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cRuby glass to come by adding gold chloride,\u201d said Turtle Heart. \u201cBut Quadling Country to sit\natop real deposits of real rubies. And the news is sure to go to the Emerald City with the builders.\nWhat to follow is horror upon horror.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d snapped Melena.\n\u201cTo look in glass,\u201d said Turtle Heart, pointing to the roundel he had made as a toy for Elphaba,\n\u201cis to see the future, in blood and rubies.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in seeing the future. That smacks of the pleasure faith,\u201d said Frex fiercely. \u201cThe\nfatalism of the Time Dragon. Pfaah. No, the Unnamed God has an unnamed history for us, and\nprophecy is merely guesswork and fear.\u201d\n\u201cFear and guesswork is enough to make Turtle Heart to leave Quadling Country, then,\u201d said the\nQuadling glassblower without apology. \u201cQuadlings do not to call their religion a pleasure faith, but\nthey to listen to signs and to watch for messages. As the water to run red with rubies it will to run\nwith the blood of Quadlings.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Frex fussed, red himself. \u201cThey need a good talking-to.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, isn\u2019t Pastorius a simpleton?\u201d said Melena, who alone of them could claim an\ninformed opinion on the royal house. \u201cWhat will he\ndo until Ozma is of age but ride the hunt, and eat Munchkinlander pastries, and fuck the odd\nhousemaid on the side?\u201d\n\u201cThe danger is a foreigner,\u201d said Turtle Heart, \u201cnot a home-grown king or queen. The old\nwomen, and the shamans, and the dying: They to see a stranger king, cruel and mighty.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the Ozma Regent doing, planning roadworks into that godforsaken mire anyway?\u201d\nMelena asked.\n\u201cProgress,\u201d said Frex, \u201csame as the Yellow Brick Road through Munchkinland. Progress and\ncontrol. The movement of troops. The regularization of taxes. Military protection.\u201d\n\u201cProtection from whom?\u201d said Melena.\n\u201cAhh,\u201d said Frex, \u201calways the important question.\u201d\n\u201cAhh,\u201d said Turtle Heart, almost in a whisper.\n\u201cSo where are you going?\u201d said Frex. \u201cNot that you need leave here, of course. Melena loves\n\n\fhaving you around. We all do.\u201d\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cHush now,\u201d said Nanny.\n\u201cLady is kind and Goodness is kind to Turtle Heart. Who did not mean to stay more than a day.\nTurtle Heart was on his way to the Emerald City and to get lost. Turtle Heart to hope to beg audience\nwith Ozma-\u201c\n\u201cOzma Regent, now,\u201d interjected Frex.\n\u201c-and to plead mercy for Quadling Country. And to warn of brutal stranger-\u201c\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d said Elphaba, clapping her hands together in delight.\n\u201cThe child to remind Turtle Heart of his duties,\u201d he said. \u201cTo talk of it brings duties back out of\nthe pain of the past. Turtle Heart to forget. But when words are to speak in the air, actions must to\nfollow.\u201d\nMelena glared hatefully at Nanny, who had dropped the girl on the ground and begun to busy\nherself with collecting the supper dishes. See what comes of prying and nosiness, Nanny? See? Just\nthe dissolution of my only earthly happiness, that\u2019s all. Melena turned her face from her horrid child,\nwho seemed to be smiling, or was that wincing? She looked at her husband with despair. Do\nsomething, Frex!\n\u201cPerhaps this is the higher ambition we seek,\u201d he was murmuring. \u201cWe should travel to\nQuadling Country, Melena. We should leave the\nluxury of Munchkinland and try ourselves in the fire of a truly needy situation.\u201d\n\u201cThe luxury of Munchkinland?\u201d Melena\u2019s voice was screechy.\n\u201cWhen the Unnamed God speaks through a lowly vessel,\u201d began Frex, gesturing at Turtle Heart,\nwho was looking desperate again, \u201cwe can choose to hear or we can choose to harden our hearts-\u201c\n\u201cWell, hear this, then,\u201d said Melena, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, Frex. I can\u2019t travel. I can\u2019t move. And with\na new infant to watch as well as Elphaba to raise, it\u2019s too much to suggest tramping around\nMudland.\u201d\nAfter the stillness had lost some of its steam, she continued, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t intend to tell you\nlike this.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Frex coldly.\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d said Elphaba to her mother. \u201cHorrors, horrors, horrors.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough thoughtless chatter for one night,\u201d said Nanny, taking charge. \u201cMelena, you will\ncatch a chill sitting out here. Summer nights are turning colder again. Come inside and let\u2019s let that\nbe that.\u201d\nBut Frex got himself up and went to kiss his wife. It was not clear to anyone whether he\nsuspected that Turtle Heart was the father, nor was it clear to Melena which one, her husband or her\nlover, was the father. She didn\u2019t actually care. She just didn\u2019t want Turtle Heart to leave, and she\nhated him fiercely for being so suddenly riven with moral feeling for his miserable people.\nFrex and Turtle Heart conversed in low voices that Melena could not make out. They sat by the\nfire with their heads low together, and Frex had his arm on Turtle Heart\u2019s shaking shoulders. Nanny\nreadied Elphaba for bed, left her outside with the men, and came to sit on Melena\u2019s bed with a glass\nof hot milk on a tray and a small bowl of medicinal capsules.\n\u201cWell, I knew this was coming,\u201d said Nanny calmly. \u201cDrink the milk, dear, and stop sniveling.\nYou\u2019re behaving like a child again. How long have you known?\u201d\n\u201cOh, six weeks,\u201d said Melena. \u201cI don\u2019t want milk, Nanny, I want my wine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll drink milk. No more wine till the baby\u2019s born. You want another disaster?\u201d\n\u201cDrinking wine doesn\u2019t change the skin color of embryos,\u201d said Melena. \u201cI may be a dolt but I\nknow that much about biology.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s bad for your frame of mind, nothing more and nothing less. Drink the milk and swallow\none of these capsules.\u201d\n\u201cwhat for?\n\u201cI did what I told you I d do said Nanny in a conspiratonal voice Last fall I poked around the\nLower Quarter of our fair capital on your\nhalf-\u201c\nThe young woman was suddenly engaged Nanny you didn\u2019t t\u2019 How .-r! Weren\u2019t you terrified?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I was. But Nanny loves you, however stupid you are. I found a store marked with the\nsecret insignia of the alchemist\u2019s trade.\u201d She wrinkled her nose in recollection of the smell of rotting\nginger and cat piss. \u201cI sat down with a saucy-looking old biddy from Shiz, a crone named Yackle,\nand drank the tea and upended the cup so she could read the leaves. Yackle could barely see her own\nhand, much less read the picture.\u201d\n\u201cA real professional,\u201d Melena said dryly.\n\u201cYour husband doesn\u2019t believe in predictions, so keep your voice down. Anyway, I explained\nabout the greenness of your first child, and the difficulty of knowing exactly why it had happened.\nWe don\u2019t want a recurrence, I said. So Yackle ground up some herbs and minerals, and toasted it\nwith oil of gomba, and said some pagan prayers and for all I know she spit in it, I didn\u2019t watch too\nclosely. But I paid for a nine months\u2019 supply, to be begun as soon as you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve conceived.\nWe\u2019re a month late maybe, but this\u2019ll be better than nothing. I have supreme confidence in this\nwoman, Melena, and you should too.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d said Melena, swallowing the first of nine capsules. It tasted like boiled\nmarrow.\n\u201cBecause Yackle predicted greatness for your children,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cShe said Elphaba will\nbe more than you credit, and your second will follow suit. She said not to give up on your life. She\nsaid history waits to be written, and this family has a part in it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does she say about my lover?\u201d\n\u201cYou are a pest,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cShe said to rest and not to worry. She gives her blessing. She is\na filthy whore but she knows what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d Nanny didn\u2019t mention that Yackle was\ncertain the next child would be a girl too. There was too much chance Melena would try to abort her,\nand Yackle sounded quite sure that history belonged to two sisters, not a single girl.\n\u201cAnd you got home safely? Did anyone suspect?\u201d\n\u201cWho would suspect innocent old Nanny of trading in illegal substances in the Lower Quarter?\u201d\nlaughed Nanny. \u201cI do my knitting and mind my own business. Now go to sleep, my love. Nix to the\nwine for the next few months, and stay the course with this medicine, and we\u2019ll have for you and\nFrex a decent, healthy child, which will provide no end of recovery for your marriage.\u201d\n\u201cMy marriage is perfectly fine,\u201d said Melena, snuggling down under the covers-the capsule had\na kick, but she didn\u2019t want Nanny to know-\u201cas long as we don\u2019t go wading off into the muddy\nsunset.\u201d\n\u201cThe sun sets in the west, not in the south,\u201d said Nanny soothingly. \u201cIt was a masterly stroke to\nbring up the pregnancy tonight, my dear. I wouldn\u2019t come to visit you if you went paddling off into\nQuadling Country, by the way. I\u2019m fifty years old this year, you know. There are some things Nanny\nis really too old to do.\u201d\n\u201cWell nobody better go anywhere,\u201d said Melena, and began to fall asleep.\nNanny, pleased with herself, glanced out the window again as she prepared to retire. Frex and\nTurtle Heart were still deep in conversation. Nanny was sharper than she let on; she had seen Turtle\nHeart\u2019s face when he was remembering the threat to his people. It had opened like a hen\u2019s egg, and\nthe truth had fluttered and wobbled out of it just as naive as a yellow chick. And as fragile. No\n\n\fwonder Frex was sitting nearer to the beleaguered Quadling than Nanny thought was altogether\ndecent. But there seemed no end of oddity to this family.\n\u201cSend the girl in so I can put her down,\u201d she called from the window, partly to interrupt their\nintimacy.\nFrex looked around. \u201cShe\u2019s in, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\nNanny glanced. The child was not given to hiding games, neither here nor with the brats in the\nvillage. \u201cNo, isn\u2019t she with you?\u201d\nThe men turned and looked. Nanny thought she saw a blur of movement in the blue shadows of\nthe wild yew. She stood up and held on to the window ledge. \u201cWell, find her. It\u2019s the prowling\nhour.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, Nanny, it\u2019s your overactive imagination,\u201d\ndrawled Frex, but the men were up quickly, and looking around.\n\u201cMelena, dear, don\u2019t sleep yet; do you know where Elphaba is? Did\nyou see her wander off?\u201d said Nanny.\nMelena struggled to lift herself to one elbow. She stared through her hair and her inebriation.\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d she asked in a slur, \u201cwho is wandering off?\u201d\n\u201cElphaba,\u201d Nanny said. \u201cCome on, you better get up. Where could be. Where could she be.\u201d\nShe started to help Melena up, but it was\nhappening too slowly, and Nanny\u2019s heart was beginning to beat fast. She\nfixed Melena\u2019s hands to the bedposts, saying, \u201cNow come on, Melena, this is not good,\u201d and\nshe reached for her blackthorn staff.\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Melena. \u201cWho\u2019s lost?\u201d\nThe men were calling in the purple gloaming. \u201cFabala! Elphaba! Elphie! Little frog!\u201d They\ncircled out away from the yard, away from the dying embers of the dinner fire, peering and hitting at\nthe lower branches of bushes. \u201cLittle snake! Lizard girl! Where are you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing, the thing has come down from the hills, whatever it is! cried Nanny.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no thing, you old fool,\u201d said Frex, but he leaped more and more vigorously from rock\nto rock behind the lodge, smacking branches aside. Turtle Heart stood still, his hands out to the sky,\nas if trying to receive the faint light of the first stars into his palms.\n\u201cIs it Elphaba,\u201d called Melena from the door, finally focusing, and stepping forward in her\nnightgown. \u201cIs the child gone?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s wandered off, she\u2019s been taken,\u201d said Nanny fiercely, \u201cthese two idiots were flirting\nlike schoolgirls, and the beast from the hills is abroad!\u201d\nMelena called, her words mounting in pitch and terror, \u201cElphaba! Elphaba, you listen to me!\nCome here this instant! Elphaba!\u201d\nThe wind alone answered.\n\u201cShe is not far,\u201d said Turtle Heart after a moment. In the deepening dark he was almost\ninvisible while Melena in her white poplin glowed like an angel, as if lit from within. \u201cShe is not\nfar, she just is not here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the devil do you mean,\u201d Nanny said, weeping, \u201cwith your riddles and your games?\u201d\nTurtle Heart turned. Frex had come back to him, to throw an arm around him and hold him up,\nand Melena came forward to his other side.\nHe sagged for a minute, as if fainting; Melena cried out in fright. But Turtle Heart straightened\nup, and began to move forward, and they headed toward the lake.\n\u201cNot the lake, not that girl, she can\u2019t abide water, you know that,\u201d called Nanny, but she was\nrushing forward now, using her staff to feel the ground ahead of her so she wouldn\u2019t stumble.\nThis is the end, thought Melena. Her brain was too foggy to think anything else, and she said it\n\n\fagain and again, as if to prevent it from being true.\nThis is the beginning, thought Frex, but of what?\n\u201cShe is not far, she is not here,\u201d said Turtle Heart again.\n\u201cPunishment for your wicked ways, you two-faced hedonists,\u201d Nanny said.\nThe ground sloped toward the still, receded margin of the lake. First at their feet, then at their\nwaists and higher, the beached dock rose, like a bridge to nowhere, ending In air.\nBeneath the dock in the dry shadows there were eyes.\n\u201cOh, sweet Lurline,\u201d whispered Nanny.\nElphaba was sitting under the dock wIth the looking glass that Turtle Heart had made. She held\nit in two hands, and stared at it with one eye closed. She peered, she squinted; her open eye was\ndistant and hollow.\nReflection from the starlight off the water, thought Frex, hoped Frex, but he knew the bright\nvacant eye was not lit by starlight.\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d murmured Elphaba.\nTurtle Heart tumbled to his knees. \u201cShe sees him coming,\u201d he said thickly, \u201cshe sees him to\ncome; he is to come from the air; is arriving. A balloon from the sky, the color of a bubble of blood:\na huge crimson globe, a ruby globe: he falls from the sky. The Regent is fallen. The House of Ozma\nis fallen. The Clock was right. A minute to judgment.\u201d\nHe fell over, almost into Elphaba\u2019s small lap. She didn\u2019t seem to notice him. Behind her was a\nlow growl. There was a beast, a feiltop tiger, or some strange hybrid of tiger and dragon, with\nglowing orangey eyes. Elphaba was sitting in its folded forearms as if on a throne.\n\u201cHorrors,\u201d she said again, looking without binocular vision, staring at the glass in which her\nparents and Nanny could make out nothing but darkness. \u201cHorrors.\u201d\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\n\n\fBook 2 - Gillikin\nWittica, Settica, Wiccas and Turning, Red Sand, Dixxi House, change at Dixxi House for Shin;\nstay aboard this coach for all points East; Tenniken, Brox Hall, and all destinations to Traum\u201d-the\nconductor paused to catch his breath-\u201cnext stop Wittica, Wittica next!\u201d\nGalinda clutched her parcel of clothes to her breast. The old goat who sprawled on the seat\nacross from her was missing the Wittica stop. She was glad that trains made passengers sleepy. She\ndidn\u2019t want to keep avoiding his eye. At the last minute before she was to board the train, her\nminder, Ama Clutch, had stepped on a rusty nail and, terrified of the frozen-face syndrome, had\nbegged permission to go to the nearest surgery for medicines and calming spells. \u201cI can surely get\nmyself to Shiz alone,\u201d Galinda had said coldly, \u201cdon\u2019t bother with me, Ama Clutch.\u201d And Ama\nClutch hadn\u2019t. Galinda hoped that Ama Clutch would suffer a little frozenness of jaw before being\nwell enough to show up in Shin and chaperone Galinda through whatever was to come.\nHer own chin was set, she believed, to imply a worldly boredom with train travel. In fact she\nhad never been more than a day\u2019s carriage ride away from her family home in the little market town\nof Frottica. The railway line, laid down a decade ago, had meant that old dairy farms were being cut\nup for country estates for the merchants and manufacturers of Shiz. But Galinda\u2019s family continued to\nprefer rural Gilhikin, with its fox haunts, its dripping dells, its secluded ancient pagan temples to\nLurline. To them, Shin was a distant urban threat, and even the convenience of rail transportation\nhadn\u2019t tempted them to risk all its complications, curiosities, and evil ways.\nGalinda didn\u2019t see the verdant world through the glass of the carriage; she saw her own\nreflection instead. She had the nearsightedness of\nyouth. She reasoned that because she was beautiful she was significant, though what she\nsignified, and to whom, was not clear to her yet. The sway of her head made her creamy ringlets\nswing, catching the light, like so many jostling stacks of coins. Her lips were perfect, as pouted as an\nopening maya flower, and colored as brilliantly red. Her green traveling gown with its inset panels\nof ochre musset suggested wealth, while the black shawl draping just so about the shoulders was a\nnod to her academic inclinations. She was, after all, on her way to Shin because she was smart.\nBut there was more than one way to be smart.\nShe was seventeen. The whole town of Frottica had seen her off. The first girl from the Pertha\nHills to be accepted at Shin! She had written well in the entrance exams, a meditation on Learning\nEthics from the Natural World. (\u201dDo Flowers Regret Being Plucked for a Bouquet? Do the Rains\nPractice Abstinence? Can Animals Really Choose to Be Good? Or: A Moral Philosophy of\nSpringtime.\u201d) She had quoted excessively from the Oziad, and her rapturous prose had captivated the\nboard of examiners. A three-year fellowship to Crage Hall. It wasn\u2019t one of the better collegesthose were still closed to female students. But it was Shiz University.\nHer companion in the compartment, waking up when the conductor came back through, stretched\nhis heels as he yawned. \u201cWould you be so kind as to reach my ticket, it\u2019s in the overhead,\u201d he said.\nGalinda stood and found the ticket, aware that the bearded old thing was eyeing her comely figure.\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d she said, and he answered, \u201cNot to me, dearie, to the conductor. Without opposable\nthumbs, I have no hope of managing such a tiny piece of cardboard.\u201d\nThe conductor punched the ticket, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the rare beast that can afford to travel first\nclass.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the goat, \u201cI object to the term beast. But the laws still allow my traveling in first\nclass, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cMoney\u2019s money,\u201d said the conductor, without ill will, punching Galinda\u2019s ticket and returning\n\n\fit to her.\n\u201cNo, money\u2019s not money,\u201d said the goat, \u201cnot when my ticket cost double what the young lady\u2019s\ndid. In this case, money is a visa. I happen to have it.\u201d\n\u201cGoing up to Shin, are you?\u201d said the conductor to Galinda, ignoring the goat\u2019s remark. \u201cI can\ntell by that academic shawl.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, it\u2019s something to do,\u201d said Galinda. She didn\u2019t care to talk to conductors. But when\nhe continued along down the carriage, Galinda found that she liked even less the baleful look that the\ngoat was giving her.\n\u201cDo you expect to learn anything at Shin?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI have already learned not to speak to strangers.\u201d\n\u201cThen I will introduce myself and we will be strangers no longer. I am Dillamond.\u201d\n\u201cI am disinclined to know you.\u201d\n\u201cI am a Fellow of Shin University, on the Faculty of Biological Arts.\u201d\nYou are a shabby dresser, even for a goat, Galinda thought. Money isn\u2019t everything. \u201cThen I\nmust overcome my natural shyness. My name is Galinda. I am of the Arduenna Clan on my mother\u2019s\nside.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be the first to welcome you to Shin, Glinda. This is your first year?\u201d\n\u201cPlease, it is Galinda. The proper old Gillikinese pronunciation, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d She could\nnot bring herself to call him sir. Not with that horrid goatee and the tatty waistcoat that looked cut\nfrom some public house carpet.\n\u201cI wonder what you think of the Wizard\u2019s proposed Banns on travel?\u201d The goat\u2019s eyes were\nbuttery and warm, and frightening. Galinda had never heard of any Banns. She said as much.\nDillamond-was it Doctor Dillamond?-explained in a conversational tone that the Wizard had\nthoughts of restricting Animal travel on public conveyances except in designated transports. Galinda\nreplied that animals had always enjoyed separate services. \u201cNo, I am speaking of Animals,\u201d said\nDillamond. \u201cThose with a spirit.\u201d\n\u201cOh, those,\u201d said Galinda crudely. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t see the problem.\u201d\n\u201cMy, my,\u201d said Dillamond. \u201cDon\u2019t you indeed?\u201d The goatee quivered; he was irritated. He\nbegan to hector her about Animal Rights. As things now stood, his own ancient mother couldn\u2019t\nafford to travel first class, and would have to ride in a pen when she wanted to visit him in Shin. If\nthe Wizard\u2019s Banns went through the Hall of Approval, as they were likely to do, the goat himself\nwould be required by law to give up the privileges he had earned through years of study, training,\nand saving. \u201cIs that right for a creature with a spirit?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom here to there, there to here, in a\npen?\u201d\n\u201cI quite agree, travel is so broadening,\u201d said Galinda. They endured the rest of the trip,\nincluding the change across the platform at Dixxi House, in a frosty silence.\nSeeing her fright at the size and bustle of the terminus at Shin, Dillamond took pity and offered\nto engage a carriage to take her to Crage Hall. She followed him, looking as unmortified as she could\nmanage. Her luggage came behind, on the backs of a couple of porters.\nShin! She tried not to gawp. Everyone hustling on business, laughing and hurrying and kissing,\ndodging carriages, while the buildings of Railway Square, brownstone and bluestone and covered\nwith vine and moss, steamed softly in the sunlight. The animals-and the Animals! She had scarcely\never come across even the odd chicken squawking philosophically in Frottica-but here was a quartet\nof tsebras at an outdoor cafe, dressed flashily in black-and-white satin stripes on the bias to their\ninborn design; and an elephant on its hind legs directing traffic; and a tiger dressed up in some sort of\nexotic religious garb, a kind of monk or maunt or nun or something. Yes, yes, it was Tsebras, and\nElephant, and Tiger, and she supposed Goat. She would have to get used to enunciating the capital\n\n\fletters or else she would show off her country origins.\nMercifully, Dillamond found her a carriage with a human driver, and directed him to Crage\nHall and paid him in advance, for which Galinda had to come up with a weak smile of appreciation.\n\u201cOur paths will cross again,\u201d said Dillamond, gallantly if curtly, as if putting forth a prophecy, and\nhe disappeared as the carriage jolted forward. Galinda sank back into the cushions. She began to be\nsorry that Ama Clutch had punctured her foot with a nail.\nCrage Hall was only twenty minutes from Railway Square. Behind its own bluestone walls, the\ncomplex was set with large watery-glass windows in lancet formation. A tessellation of quatrefoils\nand blind multifoils ran riot at the roofline. The appreciation of architecture was Galinda\u2019s private\npassion, and she pored over the features she could identify, although the vines and flatmoss fudged\nmany of the finer details of the buildings. Too soon she was whisked inside.\nThe Headmistress of Crage Hall, a fish-faced upper-class Gillikinese woman wearing a lot of\ncloisonne bangles, was greeting new arrivals in\nthe atrium. The Head eschewed the drabness of professional women\u2019s dress that Galinda had\nexpected. Instead the imposing woman was bedecked in a currant-colored gown with patterns of\nblack jet swirling over the bodice like dynamic markings on sheet music. \u201cI am Madame Morrible,\u201d\nshe said to Galinda. Her voice was basso profundo, her grip crippling, her posture military, her\nearrings like holiday tree ornaments. \u201cFlourishes all around, and a quick cup of tea in the parlor.\nThen we\u2019ll assemble in the Main Hall and sort you out as to roomies.\u201d\nThe parlor was filled with pretty young women, all wearing green or blue and trailing black\nshawls like exhausted shadows behind them. Galinda was glad for the natural advantages of her\nflaxen hair, and stood by a window so the light could dazzle itself off her curls. She hardly sipped\nthe tea. In a side room, the attendant Amas were serving themselves from a metal urn, and laughing\nand yakking already as if they were old friends from the same village. It was somewhat grotesque,\nall those dumpy women smiling at each other, making marketplace noise.\nGalinda hadn\u2019t read the fine print very closely. She hadn\u2019t realized there would be a need for\n\u201croomies.\u201d Or perhaps had her parents paid extra so she could have a private room? And where\nwould Ama Clutch stay? Looking about her, she could tell that some of these dollies came from\nfamilies much better off than hers. The pearls and diamonds on them! Galinda was glad she had\nchosen a simple silver collar with mettanite struts. There was something vulgar about traveling in\njewels. As she realized this truth, she codified it into a saying. At the earliest perfect opportunity she\nwould bring it out as proof of her having opinions-and of having traveled. \u201cThe overdressed traveler\nbetrays more interest in being seen than in seeing,\u201d she murmured, trying it out, \u201cwhile the true\ntraveler knows that the novel world about her serves as the most appropriate accessory.\u201d Good, very\ngood.\nMadame Morrible counted heads, gripped a cup of tea, and shooed everyone into the Main\nHall. There Galinda learned that allowing Ama Clutch to go looking for a surgery had been a\ncolossal mistake. Apparently all that chatter among Amas hadn\u2019t been frivolous and social. They had\nbeen instructed to sort out among them whose young lady would room with whose. The Amas had\nbeen relied upon to get to the nub of the matter more quickly than the students themselves. No one\nhad spoken for Galinda-she had gone unrepresented!\nAfter the forgettable welcome remarks, as couple by couple the students and Amas left to locate\ntheir lodgings and settle in, Galinda found herself growing pale with embarrassment. Ama Clutch,\nthe old fool, would have fixed her up nicely with someone just a notch or two above on the social\nladder! Near enough that Galinda would suffer no shame, and above enough to make it worth the\nwhile of socializing. But now, all the better young misses were linked together. Diamond to\ndiamond, emerald to emerald, for all she could tell! As the room began to empty, Galinda wondered\n\n\fif she shouldn\u2019t go up and interrupt Madame Morrible and explain the problem. Galinda was, after\nall, an Arduenna of the Uplands, at least on one side. It was a hideous accident. Her eyes teared up.\nBut she hadn\u2019t the nerve. She stayed perched on the edge of the fragile, stupid chair. Except for\nher, all the center of the room had cleared out now, and the shyer, more useless girls were left,\naround the edges, in the shadows. Surrounded by an obstacle course of empty gilded chairs, Galinda\nalone sat like an unclaimed valise.\n\u201cNow the rest of you are here without Amas, I understand,\u201d said Madame Momble, a bit\nsniffily. \u201cSince we require chaperonage, I will assign each of you to one of the three dormitories for\nfreshers, which sleep fifteen girls each. There is no social stigma to the dormitory, I might add. None\nat all.\u201d But she was lying, and not even convincingly.\nGalinda finally stood up. \u201cPlease, Madame Morrible, there is a mistake. I am Galinda of the\nArduennas. My Ama took a nail in her foot on the voyage and was detained for a day or two. I am not\nin the dormitory class, you see.\u201d\n\u201cHow sad for you,\u201d said Madame Morrible, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m sure your Ama will be pleased to be\na chaperone in, shall we say, the Pink Dormitory? Fourth floor on the right-\u201c\n\u201cNo, no, she would not,\u201d interrupted Galinda, quite bravely. \u201cI am not here to sleep in a\ndormitory, Pink or otherwise. You have misunderstood.\u201d\n\u201cI have not misunderstood, Miss Galinda,\u201d said Madame Morrible, growing even more fishlike\nas her eyes began to bulge. \u201cThere is accident, there is tardiness, there are decisions to be made. As\nyou were not equipped, through your Ama, to make your own decision, I am empowered to make it\nfor you. Please, we are busy and I must name the other girls who will join you in the Pink\nDormitory-\u201c\n\u201cI would have a private word with you, Madame,\u201d said Galinda in desperation. \u201cFor myself,\ndormitory partners or a single roomie, it is no matter. But I cannot recommend that you ask my Ama\nto oversee other girls, for reasons I may not say in public.\u201d She was lying as fast as she could, and\nbetter than Madame Morrible, who seemed at least intrigued.\n\u201cYou strike me as impertinent, Miss Galinda,\u201d she said mildly.\n\u201cI have not yet struck you, Madame Morrible.\u201d Galinda delivered the daring line with her\nsweetest smile.\nMadame Morrible chose to laugh, thank Lurline! \u201cA spark of spunk! You may come to my\nchambers this evening and tell me the story of your Ama\u2019s shortcomings, as I should know them. But\nI will compromise with you, Miss Galinda. Unless you object, I will have to ask your Ama to\nchaperone both you and another girl, one who comes without an Ama. For you see, all the other\nstudents with Amas are already paired off, and you are the odd one out.\u201d\n\u201cI am certain my Ama could manage that, at least.\u201d\nMadame Morrible scanned the page of names, and said, \u201cVery well. To join Miss Galinda of\nthe Arduennas in a double room-shall I invite the Thropp Third Descending, of Nest Hardings,\nElphaba?\u201d\nNo one stirred. \u201cElphaba?\u201d said Madame Morrible again, adjusting her bangles and pressing\ntwo fingers at the bottom of her throat.\nThe girl was in the back of the room, a pauper in a red dress with gaudy fretwork, and in\nclumpy, old-people\u2019s boots. At first Galinda thought what she saw was some trick of the light, a\nreflection off the adjacent buildings covered in vines and flatmoss. But as Elphaba moved forward,\nlugging her own carpetbags, it became obvious that she was green. A hatchet-faced girl with\nputrescent green skin and long, foreign-looking black hair. \u201cA Munchkinlander by birth, though with\nmany childhood years spent in Quadling Country,\u201d read Madame Morrible from her notes. \u201cHow\nfascinating for us all, Miss Elphaba. We shall look forward to hearing tales of exotic climes and\n\n\ftimes. Miss Galinda and Miss Elphaba, here are your keys. You may take room twenty-two on the\nsecond floor.\u201d\nShe smiled broadly at Galinda as the girls came forward. \u201cTravel is so broadening,\u201d she\nintoned. Galinda started, the curse of her own words lobbed hack at her. She curtseyed and fled.\nElphaba, eyes on the floor, followed behind.\nBy the time Ama Clutch arrived the next day, her foot bandaged to three times its natural sine,\nElphaba had already unpacked her few belongings. They hung raglike on hooks in the cupboard: thin,\nshapeless shifts, shamed into a corner by the fulsome hoops and starched bustles and padded\nshoulders and cushioned elbows of Galinda\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cI am happy as cheese to be your Ama too,\ndon\u2019t matter to me,\u201d said Ama Clutch, smiling broadly in Elphaba\u2019s direction, before Galinda had a\nchance to get Ama Clutch alone and demand that her minder refuse. \u201cOf course my Papa is paying\nyou to be my Ama,\u201d said Galinda meaningfully, but Ama Clutch answered, \u201cNot as much as all that,\nduckie, not as much as all that. I can be making up my own mind.\u201d\n\u201cAma,\u201d said Galinda when Elphaba had left to use the mildewy facilities, \u201cAma, are you blind?\nThat Munchkinlander girl is green.\u201d\n\u201cOdd, isn\u2019t it? I thought all Munchkinlanders were tiny. She\u2019s a proper height, though. I guess\nthey come in a variety of sizes. Oh, are you bothered by the green? Well, it might do you some good,\nif you let it. If you let it. You affect worldly airs, Galinda, but you don\u2019t know the world yet. I think\nit\u2019s a lark. Why not? Why ever not?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yours to organize my education, worldly or otherwise, Ama Clutch!\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear,\u201d said Ama Clutch, \u201cyou\u2019ve made this mess all by your lonesome. I\u2019m merely\nbeing of service.\u201d\nSo Galinda was stuck. Last night\u2019s brief interview with Madame Morrible had not provided\nany escape route, either. Galinda had arrived promptly, in a dotted morpheline skirt with lace\nbodice, a vision, as she\u2019d said to herself, in nocturnal purples and midnight blues. Madame Morrible\nbade her enter the reception room, in which a small cluster of leather chairs and a settee were drawn\nup before an unnecessary fire. The Head poured mint tea and offered crystallized ginger wrapped in\npearlfruit leaves. She indicated a chair for Galinda, but herself stood by the mantelpiece like a big\ngame hunter.\nIn the best tradition of the upper-class savoring its luxuries, they sipped and nibbled in silence\nat first. This gave Galinda the chance to observe that Madame Morrible was fishlike not merely in\ncountenance but in dress: Her loose-fitting cream foxille flowed like a huge airy bladder from the\nhigh frilled neckline to the knees, where it was tightly gathered and dropped straight to the floor,\nhugging the calves and ankles in neat, anticlimactic pleats. She looked for all the world like a giant\ncarp in a men\u2019s club. And a dull, bored carp at that, not even a sentient Carp.\n\u201cNow your Ama, my dear. The reason she is incapable of supervising a dormitory. I\u2019m all\nears.\u201d\nGalinda had taken all afternoon to prepare. \u201cYou see, Madame Head, I didn\u2019t like to say it\npublicly. But Ama Clutch suffered a terrible fall last summer when we were picnicking in the Pertha\nHills. She reached for a handful of wild mountain thyme and went pitching over a cliff. She lay for\nweeks in a coma, and when she emerged she had no memory of the accident at all. If you asked her\nabout it, she wouldn\u2019t even know what you meant. Amnesia by trauma.\u201d\n\u201cI see. How very tiresome for you. But why does this make her unequal to the job I proposed?\u201d\n\u201cShe has become addled. Ama Clutch, on occasion, gets confused as to what has Life and what\ndoesn\u2019t. She will sit and talk to, oh, say, a chair, and then relate its history back to us. Its aspirations,\nits reservations-\u201c\n\u201cIts joys, its sorrows,\u201d said Madame Morrible. \u201cHow truly novel. The emotional life of\n\n\ffurniture. I never.\u201d\n\u201cBut, silly as this is, and a cause for hours of merriment, the corollary ailment is more alarming.\nMadame Morrible, I must tell you that Ama Clutch sometimes forgets that people are alive. Or\nanimals.\u201d Galinda paused, then added, \u201cOr Animals, even.\u201d\n\u201cGo on, my dear.\u201d\n\u201cIt is all right for me, because Ama has been my Ama all my life, and I know her. I know her\nways. But she can sometimes forget a person is there, or needs her, or is a person. Once she cleaned\na wardrobe and tipped it over onto the houseboy, breaking his back. She didn\u2019t register his\nscreaming right there, right at her feet. She folded the nightclothes and had a conversation with my\nmother\u2019s evening gown, asking it all sorts of impertinent questions.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a fascinating condition,\u201d said Madame Morrible. \u201cAnd how vexing for you, really.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have allowed her to accept responsibility for fourteen other girls,\u201d Galinda\nconfided. \u201cFor me, alone, there is no problem. I love the foolish old woman, in a way.\u201d\nMadame Morrible had said, \u201cBut what of your roomie? Can you jeopardize her well-being?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for her.\u201d Galinda looked the Head in her glazed, unblinking eye. \u201cThe poor\nMunchkinlander appears to be used to a life of distress. Either she will adjust or, I assume, she will\npetition you to be removed from my room. Unless, of course, you feel it your duty to move her for her\nown safety.\u201d\nMadame Morrible said, \u201cI suppose if Miss Elphaba cannot live with what we give her, she will\nleave Crage Hall on her own accord. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nIt was the we in what we give her: Madame Morrible was binding Galinda into a campaign.\nThey both knew it. Galinda struggled to maintain her autonomy. But she was only seventeen, and she\nhad suffered that same indignity of exclusion in the Main Hall just hours ago. She didn\u2019t know what\nMadame Morrible could have against Elphaba except the looks of her. But there was something,\nthere was clearly something. What was it? She sensed it to be wrong somehow. \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\ndear?\u201d said Madame Morrible, bowing a bit forward like a fish arching in a slow-motion leap.\n\u201cWell, of course, we must do what we can,\u201d said Galinda, as vaguely as possible. But she\nseemed the fish, and caught on a most clever hook.\nOut of the shadows of the reception room came a small tiktok thing, about three feet high, made\nof burnished bronze, with an identifying plate screwed into its front. The plate said Smith and\nTinker\u2019s Mechanical Man, in ornate script. The clockwork servant collected the empty teacups and\nwhirred itself away. Galinda didn\u2019t know how long it had been there, or what it had heard, but she\nhad never liked tiktok creatures.\nElphaba had a bad case of what Galinnda called the reading sulks. Elphaba didn\u2019t curl up-she\nwas too bony to curl-but she jackknifed herself nearer to herself, her funny pointed green nose poking\nin the moldy leaves of a book. She played with her hair while she read, coiling it up and down\naround fingers so thin and twiglike as to seem almost exoskeletal. Her hair never curled no matter\nhow often Elphaba twined it around her\nhands. It was beautiful hair, in an odd, awful way, with a shine like the pelt of a healthy\ngiltebeast. Black silk. Coffee spun into threads. Night rain. Galinda, not given to metaphor on the\nwhole, found Elphaba\u2019s hair entrancing, the more so because the girl was otherwise so ugly.\nThey didn\u2019t talk much. Galinda was too busy forging alliances with the better girls who had\nbeen her rightful roomie prospects. No doubt she could switch rooms at half-term, or at any rate next\nfall. So Galinda left Elphaba alone, and she flew down the hall to gossip with her new friends.\nMilla, Pfannee, Shenshen. Just as in children\u2019s books about boarding school, each new friend was\nwealthier than the one before.\nAt first Galinda didn\u2019t mention who her roomie was. And Elphaba showed no sign of expecting\n\n\fGalinda\u2019s company, which was a relief. But the gossip had to start sooner or later. The first wave of\ndiscussion about Elphaba concerned her wardrobe and her evident poverty, as if her classmates\nwere above noticing her sickly and sickening color. \u201cSomeone told me that Madame Head had said\nMiss Elphaba was the Thropp Third Descending from Nest Hardings,\u201d said Pfannee, who was also a\nMunchkinlander, but one of diminutive stock, not full-size like the Thropp family. \u201cThe Thropp are\nhighly regarded in Nest Hardings and even beyond. The Eminent Thropp put together the area\u2019s\nmilitia and tore up the Yellow Brick Road that the Omar Regent had been laying in when we all\nwere small-before the Glorious Revolution. There was no callousness in the Eminent Thropp or his\nwife or family, including his granddaughter Elena, you can be assured.\u201d By callousness, of course,\nPfannee meant greenness.\n\u201cBut how the mighty have fallen! She\u2019s as ragged as a gypsy,\u201d observed Milla. \u201cHave you ever\nseen such tawdry dresses? Her Ama should be sacked.\u201d\n\u201cShe has no Ama, I think,\u201d said Shenshen. Galinda, who knew for sure, said nothing.\n\u201cThey said she had spent time in Quadling Country,\u201d Milla went on. \u201cPerhaps her family had\nbeen exiled as criminals?\u201d\n\u201cOr they were speculators in rubies,\u201d said Shenshen.\n\u201cThen where\u2019s the wealth?\u201d snapped Milla. \u201cSpeculators in rubies did very well, Miss\nShenshen. Our Miss Elphaba doesn\u2019t have two barter tokens to rub together and call her own.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a kind of religious calling? A chosen poverty?\u201d suggested Pfannee, and at this\nnonsense they all threw back their heads and chortled.\nElphaba, coming into the buttery for a cup of coffee, caused them to escalate into louder roars\nof laughter. Elphaba did not look over at them, but every other student did glance their way, each girl\nlonging to be included in the jollity, which made the four new friends feel just fine.\nGalinda was slow coming to terms with actual learning. She had considered her admission into\nShin University as a sort of testimony to her brilliance, and believed that she would adorn the halls\nof learning with her beauty and occasional clever sayings. She supposed, glumly, that she had meant\nto be a sort of living marble bust: This is Youthful Intelligence; admire Her. Isn\u2019t She lovely?\nIt hadn\u2019t actually dawned on Galinda that there was more to learn, and furthermore that she was\nexpected to do it. The education all the new girls chiefly wanted, of course, had nothing to do with\nMadame Momble or the prattling Animals at lecterns and on daises. What the girls wanted wasn\u2019t\nequations, or quotations, or orations-they wanted Shin itself. City life. The broad, offensive panoply\nof life and Life, seamlessly intertwined.\nGalinda was relieved that Elphaba never took part in the outings the Amas organized. Since\nthey often stopped at a lunchroom for a modest meal, the weekly brigade became known informally\nas the Chowder and Marching Society. The university district was aflame with autumn color, not just\nof dying leaves, but also of fraternity pennants, fluttering from rooftop and spire.\nGalinda soaked up the architecture of Shin. Here and there, mostly in protected College yards\nand side streets, the oldest surviving domestic architecture still leaned, ancient wattle-and-daub and\nexposed stud framing held up like paralytic grannies by stronger, newer relatives on either side.\nThen, in dizzying succession, unparalleled glories: Bloodstone Medieval, Merthic (both Least and\nthe more fantastical Late), Gallantine with its symmetries and restraint, Gallantine Reformed with all\nthose festering ogees and broken pediments, Bluestone Revival, Imperial Bombast, and Industrial\nModern, or, as the critics in the liberal press put it, High\nHostile Crudstyle, the form propagated by the modernity-minded Wizard of Oz.\nBesides architecture, the excitement was tame, to be sure. On one notable occasion, which no\nCrage Hall girl present ever forgot, the senior boys from Three Queens College across the canal, for\na lark and a dare, had tanked themselves up with beer in the middle of the afternoon, had hired a\n\n\fWhite Bear violinist, and had gone down to dance together under the willow trees, wearing nothing\nbut their clinging cotton drawers and their school scarves, It was deliciously pagan, as they had set\nan old chipped statue of Lurline the Fairy Queen on a three-legged stool, and she seemed to smile at\ntheir loose-limbed gaiety. The girls and the Amas pretended shock, but poorly; they lingered,\nwatching, until horrified proctors from Three Queens came rushing out to round the revelers up. Near\nnudity was one thing, but public Lurlinism-even as a joke-bordered on being intolerably retrograde,\neven royalist. And that did not do in the Wizard\u2019s reign.\nOne Saturday evening, when the Amas had a rare night off and had taken themselves in to a\npleasure faith meeting in Ticknor Circus, Galinda had a brief and silly squabble with Pfanriee and\nShenshen, after which she retired early to her bedchamber, complaining of a headache. Elphaba was\nsitting up in her bed with the commissary brown blanket tucked around her. She was hunched\nforward over a book, as usual, and her hair hung down like brackets on either side of her face. She\nlooked to Galinda like one of those etchings-the natural history books were full of them-of odd\nWinkie mountain women who hide their strangeness with a shawl over the head. Elphaba was\nmunching on the pips of an apple, having eaten all the rest of it. \u201cWell, you look cozy enough, Miss\nElphaba,\u201d said Galinda, challengingly. In three months it was the first social remark she had\nmanaged to make to her roomie.\n\u201cLooks are only looks,\u201d said Elphaba, not looking up.\n\u201cWill it break your concentration if I sit in front of the fire?\u201d\n\u201cYou cast a shadow if you sit just there.\u201d\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said Galinda, and moved. \u201cMustn\u2019t cast shadows, must we, when urgent words are\nwaiting to be read?\u201d\nElphaba was back in her book already, and didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cWhat the dickens are you reading, night and day?\u201d\nIt seemed as if Elphaba were coming up for air from a still, isolated pool. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t read\nthe same thing every day, you know, tonight I am reading some of the speeches of the early unionist\nfathers.\u201d\n\u201cWhy ever would anyone want to do that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know if I want to read them. I\u2019m just reading them.\u201d\n\u201cBut why? Miss Elphaba the Delirious, why, why?\u201d\nElphaba looked up at Galinda and smiled. \u201cElphaba the Delirious. I like it.\u201d\nBefore she had a chance to bite it back, Gallinda returned the smile, and at the same time a\nsweeping wind sent a handful of hail against the glass, and the latch broke. Galinda leaped to swing\nthe casement shut, but Elphaba scuttled to the far corner of the room, away from the wet. \u201cGive me\nthe leather luggage grip, Miss Elphaba, from inside my satchel-there on the shelf, behind the\nhatboxes-yes-and I\u2019ll secure this until we can get the porter to fix it tomorrow.\u201d Elphaba found the\nstrap, but in doing so the hat boxes tumbled down, and three colorful hats rolled out onto the cold\nfloor. While Galinda scrabbled up on a chair to organize the window shut again, Elphaba returned\nthe hats to their boxes. \u201cOh, try it on, try that one on,\u201d said Galinda. She meant to have something to\nlaugh at, to tell Misses Pfannee and Shenshen about and so to work her way back into their good\ngraces.\n\u201cOh, I daren\u2019t, Miss Galinda,\u201d Elphaba said, and went to set the hat away.\n\u201cNo, do, I insist,\u201d Galinda said, \u201cfor a lark. I\u2019ve never seen you in something pretty.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wear pretty things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d said Galinda. \u201cJust here. No one else need see you.\u201d\nElphaba stood facing the fire, but turned her head on her shoulders to look long and unblinkingly\nat Galinda, who had not yet hopped down from the chair. The Munchkinlander was in her nightgown,\n\n\fa drab sack without benefit of lace edging or piping. The green face above the wheatgray fabric\nseemed almost to glow, and the glorious long straight black hair fell right over where breasts should\nbe if she would ever reveal any evidence that she possessed them. Elphaba looked like something\nbetween an\nanimal and an animal like something more than life but not quite Life.\nThere was an expectancy but no intuition, was that it?-like a child who has never remembered\nhaving a dream being told to have sweet dreams. You\u2019d almost call it unrefined, but not in a social\nsense-more in a sense of nature not having done its full job with Elphaba, not quite having managed\nto make her enough like herself.\n\u201cOh, put the damn hat on, really,\u201d said Galinda, for whom, where introspection was concerned,\nenough was enough.\nElphaba obliged. The thing was the lovely roundel bought from the best milliner in the Pertha\nHills. It had orangey swags and a yellow lace net that could be draped to achieve varying degrees of\ndisguise. On the wrong head it would look ghastly, and Galinda expected to have to bite the inside of\nher lip to keep from laughing. It was the kind of super-feminine thing boys in a pantomime wore\nwhen they pretended to be girls.\nBut Elphaba dropped the whole sugary plate onto her strange pointed head, and looked at\nGallinda again from underneath the broad brim. She seemed like a rare flower, her skin stemlike in\nits soft pearlescent sheen, the hat a botanical riot. \u201cOh Miss Elphaba,\u201d said Galinda, \u201cyou terrible\nmean thing, you\u2019re pretty.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and now you have lied, so go confess to the unionist minister,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIs there a\nlooking glass?\u201d\n\u201cOf course there is, down the hall in the lavatory.\u201d\n\u201cNot there. I\u2019m not going to be seen by those ninnies in this.\u201d\n\u201cWell then,\u201d decided Galinda, \u201ccan you find an angle without hiding the firelight, and look at\nyour reflection in the dark window?\u201d\nThey both gazed at the green and flowery spectre reflected in the watery old glass, surrounded\nby the blackness, driven through with the wild rain beyond. A maplefruit leaf, shaped like a star with\nblunted points, or like a heart grown lopsided, suddenly whirled out of the night and plastered itself\non the reflection in the glass, gleaming red and reflecting the firelight, just where the heart would beor so it seemed from the angle at which Galinda stood.\n\u201cEntrancing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s some strange exotic quality of beauty about you. I never\nthought.\u201d\n\u201cSurprise,\u201d said Elphaba, and then nearly blushed, if darker green\nconstituted a blush-\u201cI mean, surprise, not beauty. It\u2019s just surprise. \u2018Well, what do you know.\u2019\nIt\u2019s not beauty.\u201d\n\u201cWho am I to argue,\u201d said Galinda, tossing her curls and striking a pose, and Elphaba actually\nlaughed at that, and Galinda laughed back, partly horrified as she did so. Elphaba tore the hat off\nthen, and returned it to its box, and when she picked up her book again Galinda said, \u201cSo what is\nBeauty reading anyway? I mean really, tell me, why the old sermons?\u201d\n\u201cMy father is a unionist minister,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI\u2019m just curious what it\u2019s all about, that\u2019s\nall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask him?\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t answer. Her face took on a solid, waiting look, like that of an owl just about to\ngo for a mouse.\n\u201cSo what\u2019re they on about? Anything interesting?\u201d said Galinda. No sense giving up now, there\nwas nothing else to do and she was too wrought up by the storm to sleep.\n\n\f\u201cThis one is thinking about good and evil,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWhether they really exist at all.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yawn,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cEvil exists, I know that, and its name is Boredom, and ministers are\nthe guiltiest crew of all.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really think that?\u201d\nGalinda didn\u2019t often stop to consider whether she believed in what she said or not; the whole\npoint of conversation was flow. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean to insult your father, for all I know he is an\nentertaining and lively preacher.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean do you think evil really exists?\u201d\n\u201cWell, how do I know what I think?\u201d\n\u201cWell, ask yourself Miss Galinda. Does evil exist?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You say. Does evil exist?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to know.\u201d The look went slanty and inwards somehow, or was it the hair\nswinging forward like a veil again?\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your father? I don\u2019t understand. He should know, that\u2019s his job.\u201d\n\u201cMy father taught me a lot,\u201d Elphaba said slowly. \u201cHe was very well educated indeed. He\ntaught me to read and write and think, and more. But not enough. I just think, like our teachers here,\nthat if ministers are effective, they\u2019re good at asking questions to get you to think. I don\u2019t think\nthey\u2019re supposed to have the answers. Not necessarily.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, tell that to our boring minister at home. He has all the answers, and charges for them,\ntoo.\u201d\n\u201cBut maybe there\u2019s something to what you say,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI mean, evil and boredom. Evil\nand ennui. Evil and the lack of stimulation. Evil and sluggish blood.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re writing a poem, it sounds like. Why ever would a girl be interested in evil?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in it. It\u2019s just what the early sermons are all on about. So I\u2019m thinking about\nwhat they\u2019re thinking about, that\u2019s all. Sometimes they talk about diet and not eating Animals, and\nthen I think of that. I just like to think about what I\u2019m reading. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t read very well. So I don\u2019t think I think very well either.\u201d Galinda smiled. \u201cI dress to\nkill, though.\u201d\nThere was no response from Elphaba. Galinda, usually pleased that she knew the correct way\nto steer every conversation into a paean to herself, was flummoxed. She lamely ventured on, annoyed\nat having to expend the effort. \u201cWell, whatever did those old brutes think about evil, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly. They seemed to be obsessed with locating it somewhere. I mean, an\nevil spring in the mountains, an evil smoke, evil blood in the veins going from parent to child. They\nwere sort of like the early explorers of Oz, except the maps they made were of invisible stuff, pretty\ninconsistent one with the other.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where is evil located?\u201d Galinda asked, flopping onto her bed and closing her eyes.\n\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t agree, did they? Or else what would they have to write sermons arguing\nabout? Some said the original evil was the vacuum caused by the Fairy Queen Lurline leaving us\nalone here. When goodness removes itself, the space it occupies corrodes and becomes evil, and\nmaybe splits apart and multiplies. So every evil thing is a sign of the absence of deity.\u201d\n\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t know an evil thing if it fell on me,\u201d said Galinda.\n\u201cThe early unionists, who were a lot more Lurlinist than unionists are today, argued that some\ninvisible pocket of corruption was floating around the neighborhood, a direct descendent of the pain\nthe world felt when Lurline left. Like a patch of cold air on a warm still night. A perfectly agreeable\nsoul might march through it and become infected, and then go and kill a neighbor. But\nthen was it your fault if you walked through a patch of badness? If you couldn\u2019t see it? There\nwasn\u2019t ever any council of unionists that decided it one way or the other, and nowadays so many\n\n\fpeople don\u2019t even believe in Lurline.\u201d\n\u201cBut they believe in evil still,\u201d said Galinda with a yawn. \u201cIsn\u2019t that funny, that deity is passe\nbut the attributes and implications of deity linger-\u201c\n\u201cYou are thinking!\u201d Elphaba cried. Galinda raised herself to her elbows at the enthusiasm in\nher roomie\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI am about to sleep, because this is profoundly boring to me,\u201d Galinda said, but Elphaba was\ngrinning from ear to ear.\nIn the morning Ama Clutch regaled them both with tales of the night out. There was a talented\nyoung witch in nothing but shocking pink undergarments, adorned with feathers and beads. She sang\nsongs to the audience and collected food tokens in her cleavage from the blushing undergraduate men\nin the nearer tables. She did a little domestic magic, turning water into orange juice, changing\ncabbages into carrots, and running knives through a terrified piglet, which spouted champagne\ninstead of blood. They all had a sip. A terrible fat man with a beard came on and chased the witch\naround as if he would kiss her-oh, it was too funny, too funny! In the end the whole cast and audience\ntogether stood and sang \u201cWhat We Don\u2019t Allow in the Public Halls (In Fact Is for Sale in the\nCheaper Stalls).\u201d The Amas had a riotous good time, every one of them.\n\u201cReally,\u201d said Galinda sniffily. \u201cThe pleasure faith is so-so common.\u201d\n\u201cBut I see the window broke,\u201d said Ama Clutch. \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t boys trying to climb in.\u201d\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d said Galinda. \u201cIn that storm?\u201d\n\u201cWhat storm?\u201d said Ama Clutch. \u201cThat don\u2019t make sense. Last night was as calm as moonlight.\u201d\n\u201cHah, that was some show,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cYou were so caught up in pleasure faith you lost\nyour bearings, Ama Clutch.\u201d They went down to breakfast together, leaving Elphaba still asleep, or\npretending to be asleep maybe. Though as they walked along the corridors, sun through the broad\nwindows making racks of light on the cold slate floors, Galinda did wonder about the capriciousness\nof weather. Was it even possible for\na storm to pitch itself against one part of town and overlook another? There was so much about\nthe world she didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cShe did nothing but chatter about evil,\u201d said Galinda to her friends, over buttered brisks with\nploughfoot jelly. \u201cSome inside tap was turned on, and prattle just poured out of her. And, girls, when\nshe tried on my hat, I could\u2019ve died. She looked like somebody\u2019s maiden aunt come up out of the\ngrave, I mean as frumpy as a Cow. I endured it only for you, so I could tell you all; otherwise I\u2019d\nhave expired with glee on the spot. It was so very much!\u201d\n\u201cYou poor thing, to have to be our spy and stand the shame of that grasshopper roomie!\u201d said\nPfannee devoutly, clasping Galinda\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re too good!\u201d\nOne evening-the first evening of snow-Madame Morrible held a poetry soiree. Boys from Three\nQueens and Ozma Towers were invited. Galinda brought out her cerise satin gown with the matching\nshawl and slippers and an heirloom Gillikinese fan, painted with a pattern of ferns and phoenix. She\narrived early to lay claim to the upholstered chair that would best set off her own attire, and she\ndragged the chair over to the bookshelves so that the light from library tapers would gently fall on\nher. The rest of the girls-not only the freshers, but the sophisters and seniors-entered in a whispering\nclot and arranged themselves on sofas and lounges in Crage Hall\u2019s nicest parlor. The boys who came\nwere somewhat disappointing; there weren\u2019t that many, and they looked terrified, or giggled with\none another. Then the professors and doctors arrived, not just the Animals from Crage Hall, but the\nboys\u2019 professors too, who were mostly men. The girls began to be glad they had dressed well, for\nwhile the boys were a spotty bunch, the male professors had grave and charming smiles.\nEven some of the Amas came, though they sat behind a screen at the back of the room. The\nsound of their knitting needles going at a rapid rate was soothing to Galinda, somehow. She knew\n\n\fAma Clutch would be there.\nThe double doors at the end of the parlor were swept open by that little bronze industrial crab\nGalinda had met on her first evening at Crage Hall. It had been especially serviced for the occasion;\nyou could still detect the cutting scent of metal polish. Madame Morrible then made an entrance,\nsevere and striking in a coal black cape, which she let drop to the floor (the thingy picked it up and\nslung it over a sofa back); her gown was a fiery orange, with abalone lake shells stitched all over it.\nDespite herself Galinda had to admire the effect. In tones even more unctuous than usual, Madame\nMorrible welcomed the visitors and led polite applause at the notion of Poetry and Its Civilizing\nEffects.\nThen she spoke on the new verse form sweeping the social parlors and poetry dens of Shin. \u201cIt\nis known as the Quell,\u201d said Madame Morrible, in her Headmistress\u2019s smile displaying an\nimpressive assembly of teeth. \u201cThe Quell is a brief poem, uplifting in nature. It pairs a sequence of\nthirteen short lines with a concluding, unrhyming apothegm. The reward of the poem is in the\nrevealing contrast between rhyming argument and concluding remark. Sometimes they may contradict\neach other, but always they illuminate and, like all poetry, sanctify life.\u201d She beamed like a beacon\nin a fog. \u201cTonight especially, a Quell might serve as an anodyne to the unpleasant disruptions we\nhave been hearing about in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d The boy students looked at least alert, and all the\nprofessors nodded, though Galinda could tell none of the girl students had a clue as to what\n\u201cunpleasant disruptions\u201d Madame Morrible was prattling on about.\nA third-year girl at the hammer-strung keyboard clattered out a couple of chords, and the guests\ncleared their throats and looked at their shoes. Galinda saw Elphaba arrive in the back of the room,\ndressed in her usual casual red shift, two books under her arm and a scarf wound around her head.\nShe sank into the last empty chair, and bit into an apple just as Madame Morrible was drawing in a\ndramatic breath to begin.\nSing a hymn to rectitude,\nYe forward-thinking multitude.\nAdvance in humble gratitude\nFor strictest rules of attitude.\nTo elevate the Common Good\nIn Brotherhood and Sisterhood\nWe celebrate authority.\nFraternity, Sorority,\nUnited, pressing onward, we\nRestrict the ills of liberty.\nThere is no numinosity\nLike Power\u2019s generosity\nIn helping curb atrocity.\nBear down on the rod and foil the child.\nMadame Morrible lowered her head to signify that she was done. There was a rumbling of\nindistinct comments. Galinda, who didn\u2019t know much about Poetry, thought perhaps this was the\naccepted way of appreciating it. She grumbled a little bit to Shenshen, who sat in a straightback chair\nto one side, looking dropsical. Wax from the taper was about to drip onto Shenshen\u2019s silkshouldered white gown with the lemon-chiffon swags, and ruin it, most likely, but Galinda decided\nShenshen\u2019s family could afford to replace a gown. She kept still.\n\u201cAnother,\u201d said Madame Momble. \u201cAnother Quell.\u201d\nThe room grew silent, but a little uneasily so?\nAlas! For impropriety,\n\n\fThe guillotine of piety.\nTo remedy society\nIndulge not to satiety\nIn mirth and shameless gaiety.\nChoose sobering sobriety.\nBehave as if the deity\nApproaches in its mystery,\nAnd greet it with sonority.\nLet your especial history\nBe built upon sorority\nWhose Virtues do exemplify,\nAnd Social Good thus multiply.\nAnimals should be seen and not heard.\nAgain, there was mumbling, but it was of a different nature now, a meaner key. Doctor\nDillamond harrumphed and beat a cloven hoof against the floor, and was heard to say, \u201cWell that\u2019s\nnot poetry, that\u2019s propaganda, and it\u2019s not even good propaganda at that.\u201d\nElphaba sidled over to Galinda\u2019s side with her chair under her arm, and plunked it down\nbetween Galinda and Shenshen. She put her bony behind on its slatted seat and leaned to Galinda and\nasked, \u2018What do you make of this?\u201d\nIt was the first time Galinda had ever been addressed by Elphaba in public. Mortification\nbloomed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said faintly, looking in the other direction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cleverness, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI mean that last line, you couldn\u2019t tell by that fancy\naccent whether it was meant to be Animals or animals. No wonder Dillamond\u2019s furious.\u201d\nAnd he was. Doctor Dillamond looked around the room as if trying to marshal the opposition.\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cDeeply shocked,\u201d he amended, and he marched out of the room.\nProfessor Lenx, the Boar who taught math, left too, accidentally crushing an antique gilded sideboard\nthrough trying to avoid stepping on Miss Milla\u2019s yellowlace train. Mister Mikko, the Ape who taught\nhistory, sat dolefully in the shadows, too confused and ill at ease to make a move. \u201cWell,\u201d said\nMadame Momble in a carrying tone, \u201cone expects poetry, if it is Poetry, to offend. It is the Right of\nArt.\u201d\n\u201cI think she\u2019s bonkers,\u201d said Elphaba. Galinda found it too horrible. What if even one of the\npimply boys saw Elphaba whispering to her! She\u2019d never hold her head up in society again. Her life\nwas ruined. \u201cShhh, I\u2019m listening, I love poetry,\u201d Galinda told her sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me, you\u2019re\nruining my evening.\u201d\nElphaba sat back, and finished her apple, and they both kept listening. The grumbling and\nmurmuring grew louder after each poem, and the boys and girls began to relax and look around at\none another.\nWhen the last Quell of the evening had knelled (to the cryptic aphorism \u201cA witch in time saves\nnine\u201d), Madame Morrible retired to uneven applause. She allowed her bronze servant to administer\ntea to the guests, and then the girls, and finally the Amas. In a heap of rustling silk and clicking\nabalone lake shells, she received compliments from the male professors and some of the braver\nboys, and begged them to sit near her so she could enjoy their criticisms. \u201cDo tell the truth. I was\noverly dramatic, wasn\u2019t I? It is my curse. The stage called, but I chose a life of Service to Girls.\u201d\nShe lowered her eyelashes in modesty as her captive audience mumbled a lukewarm protest.\nGalinda was still trying to extricate herself from the embarrassing company of Elphaba, who\nkept on about the Quells and what they meant, and if they were any good. \u201cHow do I know, how\nshould I know, we\u2019re first-year girls, remember?\u201d said Galinda, yearning to swish over to where\n\n\fPfannee, Milla, and Shenshen were squeezing lemons into the teacups of a few edgy boys.\n\u201cWell, your opinion is as good as hers, I think,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThat\u2019s the real power of art, I\nthink. Not to chide but to provoke challenge. Otherwise why bother?\u201d\nA boy came up to them. Galinda thought he wasn\u2019t much to look at, but anything was better than\nthe green leech at her side. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d said Galinda, not even waiting for him to get up his\nnerve. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you. You must be from, let\u2019s see-\u201c\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m from Briscoe Hall, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Munchkinlander originally. As you\ncan tell.\u201d And she could, for he hardly came up to her shoulder. He wasn\u2019t bad looking for all that. A\nspun-cotton mess of ill-combed golden hair, a toothy smile, a better complexion than some. The\nevening tunic he wore was a provincial blue, but there were flecks of silver thread running through\nit. He was trim, nicely so. His boots were polished and he stood a little bandy-legged, feet pointed\nout.\n\u201cThis is what I love,\u201d said Galinda, \u201cmeeting strangers. This is Shia at its finest. I am\nGillikinese.\u201d She just managed to keep herself frost adding, of course, for she believed it evident in\nher attire. Munchkinlander girls had a habit of quieter dress, so understated that they were often\nmistaken, in Shiz, for servants.\n\u201cWell then, hello to you,\u201d said the boy. \u201cMy name is Master Boq.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Galinda of the Arduennas of the Uplands.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d said Boq, turning to Elphaba. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cFresh dreams, all.\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t leave,\u201d said Boq. \u201cI think I know you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d said Elphaba, pausing as she turned \u201cHowever could you know me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Miss Elphie, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cMiss Elphie!\u201d cried Galinda gaily. \u201cHow delightful!\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cMaster Boq from Munchkinland? I don\u2019t know\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cYou and I played together when you were tiny,\u201d said Boq. \u201cMy father was the mayor of the\nvillage you were born in. I think. You were born in Rush Margins, in Wend Hardings, weren\u2019t you?\nYou\u2019re the daughter of the unionist minister, I forget his name.\u201d\n\u201cFrex,\u201d said Elphaba. Her eyes looked slanted and wary.\n\u201cFrexspar the Godly!\u201d said Boq. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You know they still talk about him, and your\nmama, and the night the Clock of the Time Dragon came to Rush Margins. I was two or three years\nold and they took me to see it, but I don\u2019t remember that. I do remember that you were in a play set\nwith me when I was still in short pants. Do you remember Gawnette? She was the woman who\nminded us. And Bree? He is my dad. Do you remember Rush Margins?\u201d\n\u201cThis is all smoke and guesswork,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cHow can I contradict? Let me tell you about\nwhat happened in your life before you can remember it. You were born a frog.\u201d (This was unkind, as\nBoq did have an amphibious look about him.) \u201cYou got sacrificed to the Clock of the Time Dragon\nand were turned into a boy. But on your marriage night when your wife opens her legs you\u2019ll turn\nback into a tadpole and-\u201c\n\u201cMiss Elphaba!\u201d cried Galinda, flicking open her fan to wave the flush of shame from her face.\n\u201cYour tongue!\u201d\n\u201cOh well, I have no childhood,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cSo you can say what you like. I grew up in\nQuadling Country with the marsh people. I squelch when I walk. You don\u2019t want to talk to me. Talk\nto Miss Galinda, she\u2019s much better in parlors than I am. I have to go now.\u201d Elphaba nodded a good\nnight salute and escaped, almost at a run.\n\u201cWhy did she say all that?\u201d said Boq, no embarrassment in his voice, just wonder. \u201cOf course I\n\n\fremember her. How many green people are there?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just possible,\u201d considered Galinda. \u201cthat she didn\u2019t like being recognized on account of\nher skin color. I don\u2019t know for sure, but perhaps she\u2019s sensitive about it.\u201d\n\u201cShe must know that it\u2019s what people would remember.\u201d\n\u201cWell, as far as I am aware, you are right about who she is,\u201d Galinda went on. \u201cThey tell me\nher great-grandfather is the Eminent Thropp of Colwen Grounds in Nest Hardings.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d Boq said. \u201cElphie. I never thought I\u2019d see her again.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t you have some more tea? I\u2019ll call the server,\u201d Galinda said. \u201cLet us sit here and you can\ntell me all about Munchkinland. I am aquiver with curiosity.\u201d She perched herself back on the chairin-sympathetic-colors and looked her very best. Boq sat down, and shook his head, as if bewildered\nby the apparition of Elphaba.\nWhen Galinda retired that evening, Elphaba was already in bed, blankets pulled up over her\nhead, and a patently theatrical snore issuing forth. Galinda huffed herself into bed with a lump,\nannoyed that she could feel rejected by the green girl.\nIn the week that followed much was said about the evening of Quells. Doctor Dillamond\ninterrupted his biology lecture to call for a response from his students. The girls didn\u2019t understand\nwhat a biological response to poetry might be and sat silent at his leading questions. He finally\nexploded, \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone make the connection between the expression of those thoughts and what\u2019s\nbeen going on in the Emerald City?\u201d\nMiss Pfannee, who didn\u2019t believe she was paying tuition in order to be yelled at, snapped back\nat him. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the tiniest notion what\u2019s going on in the Emerald City! Stop playing games\nwith us; if you have something to say, say it. Don\u2019t bleat so.\u201d\nDoctor Dillamond stared out the windows and seemed to be trying to control his temper. The\nstudents were thrilled with the little drama. Then the Goat turned and in a milder voice than they\nexpected he told them that the Wizard of Oz had proclaimed Banns on Animal Mobility, effective\nseveral weeks ago. This meant not only that Animals were restricted in their access to travel\nconveyances, lodgings, and public services. The Mobility it referred to was also professional. Any\nAnimal coming of age was prohibited from working in the professions or the public\nsector. They were, effectively, to be herded back to the farmlands and wilds if they wanted to\nwork for wages at all.\n\u201cWhat do you think Madame Morrible was saying when she ended that Quell with the epigram\nAnimals should be seen and not heard?\u201d asked the Goat tersely.\n\u201cWell, anyone would be upset,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cI mean, any Animal. But it\u2019s not as if your job is\nthreatened, is it? Here you are, still teaching us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my children? What about my kids?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have kids? I didn\u2019t know you were married.\u201d\nThe Goat closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not married, Miss Galinda. But I might be. Or I may. Or perhaps\nI have nieces and nephews. They have already been banned effectively from studying at Shin because\nthey can\u2019t hold a pencil to write an essay with. How many Animals have you ever seen in this\nparadise of education?\u201d Well, it was true; there were none.\n\u201cWell, I do think it\u2019s pretty dreadful,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cWhy would the Wizard of Oz do such a\nthing?\u201d\n\u201cWhy indeed,\u201d said the Goat.\n\u201cNo, really, why. It\u2019s a real question. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d The Goat turned to his rostrum and shoved some papers this way and\nthat, and was then seen pawing a handkerchief from a lower shelf, and blowing his nose. \u201cMy\ngrandmothers were milking-Goats at a farm in Gillikin. Through their lifelong sacrifices and labors\n\n\fthey purchased the help of a local schoolteacher to educate me and to take dictation when I went for\nmy exams. Their efforts are about to go to waste.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can still teach!\u201d said Pfannee petulantly.\n\u201cThe thin edge of the wedge, my dear,\u201d said the Goat, and dismissed the class early. Galinda\nfound herself glancing over toward Elphaba, who had a strange, focused look. As Galinda fled the\nclassroom, Elphaba approached the front of the room, where Doctor Dillamond stood shaking in\nuncontrolled spasms, his horned head bowed.\nA few days later, Madame Morrible gave one of her occasional open lectures on Early Hymns\nand Pagan Paeans. She called for questions, and the entire assembly was startled to see Elphaba\nunfold herself from her customary fetal position in the back of the room and address the Head.\n\u201cMadame Morrible, if you please,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cwe never had an opportunity to discuss the\nQuells that you recited in the parlor last week.\u201d\n\u201cDiscuss,\u201d said Madame Morrible with a generous though shooing wave of the bangled hands.\n\u201cWell, Doctor Dillamond seemed to think they were in questionable taste, given the Banns on\nAnimal Mobility.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Dillamond, alas,\u201d said Madame Morrible, \u201cis a doctor. He is not a poet. He is also a\nGoat, and I might ask you girls if we have ever had a great Goat sonneteer or balladeer? Alas, dear\nMiss Elphaba, Doctor Dillamond doesn\u2019t understand the poetic convention of irony. Would you like\nto define irony for the class, please?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe I can, Madame.\u201d\n\u201cIrony, some say, is the art of juxtaposing incongruous parts. One needs a knowing distance.\nIrony presupposes detachment, which, alas, in the case of Animal Rights, we may forgive Doctor\nDillamond for being without.\u201d\n\u201cSo that phrase that he objected to-Animals should be seen and not heard-that was ironic?\u201d\ncontinued Elphaba, studying her papers and not looking at Madame Morrible. Galinda and her\nclassmates were enthralled, for it was clear that each of the females at opposite ends of the room\nwould have enjoyed seeing the other crumple in a sudden attack of the spleen.\n\u201cOne could consider it in an ironic mode if one chose,\u201d said Madame Morrible.\n\u201cHow do you choose?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cHow impertinent!\u201d said Madame Morrible.\n\u201cWell, but I don\u2019t mean impertinence. I\u2019m trying to learn. If you- if anyone-thought that\nstatement was true, then it isn\u2019t in conflict with the boring bossy bit that preceded it. It\u2019s just\nargument and conclusion, and I don\u2019t see the irony.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see much, Miss Elphaba,\u201d said Madame Morrible. \u201cYou must learn to put yourself\nin the shoes of someone wiser than you are, and look from that angle. To be stuck in ignorance, to be\ncircumscribed by the walls of one\u2019s own modest acumen, well, it Is very sad in one so young and\nbright.\u201d She spit out the last word, and it seemed to Galinda, somehow, a low comment on Elphaba\u2019s\nskin color, which today was indeed lustrous with the effort of public speaking.\n\u201cBut I was trying to put myself in the shoes of Doctor Dillamond,\u201d said Elphaba, almost\nwhining, but not giving up.\n\u201cIn the case of poetic interpretation, I venture to suggest, it may indeed be true. Animals should\nnot be heard,\u201d snapped Madame Morrible.\n\u201cDo you mean that ironically?\u201d said Elphaba, but she sat down with her hands over her face,\nand did not look up again for the rest of the session.\nWhen the second semester began, and Galinda was still saddled with Elphaba as a roomie, she\nmade a brief protest to Madame Morrible. But the Head would allow no shifting, no rearranging.\n\u201cFar too upsetting for my other girls,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you\u2019d like to be removed to the Pink\n\n\fDormitory. Your Ama Clutch seems, to my watchful eye, to be recovering from the ailments you\ndescribed when first we met. Perhaps now she is up to overseeing fifteen girls?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Galinda quickly. \u201cThere are recurrences from time to time, but I don\u2019t mention\nthem. I don\u2019t like to be a bother.\u201d\n\u201cHow thoughtful,\u201d said Madame Momble. \u201cBless you, sweet thing. Now my dear, I wonder if\nwe might take a moment, as long as you\u2019ve come in for a chat, to discuss your academic plans for\nnext fall? As you know, second year is when girls choose their specialties. Have you given it any\nthought?\u201d\n\u201cVery little,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cFrankly, I thought my talents would just emerge and make it clear\nwhether I should try natural science, or the arts, or sorcery, or perhaps even history. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m\ncut out for ministerial work.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that one such as you should be in doubt,\u201d said Madame Morrible, which\nwasn\u2019t greatly encouraging to Galinda. \u201cBut may I suggest sorcery? You could be very good at it. I\npride myself on knowing this sort of thing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d said Galinda, though her early appetite for sorcery had waned once she\u2019d\nheard what a grind it was to learn spells and, worse, to understand them.\n\u201cIn the event you choose sorcery, it might-just might-be possible to find for you a new roomie,\u201d\nsaid Madame Morrible, \u201cgiven that\nMiss Elphaba has already told me her interests lie in the natural sciences.\u201d\n\u201cOh well then, I certainly will give it a great deal of thought,\u201d said Galinda. She struggled with\nunnamed conflicts within her. Madame Morrible, for all her upper-class diction and fabulous\nwardrobe, seemed just a tad-oh-dangerous. As if her big public smile were composed of the light\nglancing off knives and lances, as if her deep voice masked the rumbling of distant explosions.\nGalinda always felt as if she couldn\u2019t see the whole picture. It was disconcerting, and to her credit at\nleast Galinda felt inside herself the ripping apart of some valuable fabric-was it integrity?-when she\nsat in Madame Morrible\u2019s parlor and drank the perfect tea.\n\u201cFor the sister, I hear, is eventually coming up to Shin,\u201d concluded Madame Morrible a few\nminutes later, as if silence had not intervened, and several tasty biscuits, \u201cbecause there\u2019s nothing I\ncan do to stop it. And that, I understand, would be dreadful. You would not like it. The sister being\nas she is. Undoubtedly spending much time in Miss Elphaba\u2019s room, being tended to.\u201d She smiled\nwanly. A puff of powdery aroma came forward from the flank of her neck, almost as if Madame\nMorrible could somehow dispense a pleasant personal odor at will.\n\u201cThe sister being as she is.\u201d Madame Morrible tutted and wagged her head back and forth as\nshe saw Galinda to the door. \u201cMiserable, really, but I suppose we shall all pull together and cope.\nThat is sorority, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Head grasped her shawl and put a gentle hand on Galinda\u2019s shoulder.\nGalinda shivered, and was sure Madame Morrible felt it, knew it, but the Head never registered a\nsign of it. \u201cBut then, my use of sorority-how ironic. Too witty. Given a long enough time, of course, a\nwide enough frame, there is nothing said or done, ever, that isn\u2019t ironic in the end.\u201d She squeezed\nGalinda\u2019s shoulder blade as if it were a bicycle handle. almost harder than was proper for a woman\nto do. \u201cWe can only hope- ha ha-that the sister comes with some veils of her own! But that\u2019s year\nyet. Meanwhile we have time. Think about sorcery, would you? Do Now good-bye, my pet, and\nfresh dreams.\u201d\nGalinda walked back to her room slowly, wondering what Elphaba\u2019s sister was like to provoke\nthose catty remarks about veils. She wanted to ask Elphaba. But she couldn\u2019t think of how to do it.\nShe didn\u2019t have the nerve.\nCome on out,\u201d said the boys. \u201cCome out.\u201d They were leaning in the archway to Boq\u2019s room, a\npell-mell clot of them, backlit by the oil lamp in the study beyond. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of books. Come with\n\n\fus.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d said Boq. \u201cI\u2019m behind in irrigation theory.\u201d\n\u201cFuck your irrigation theory when the pubs are open,\u201d said the strapping Gillikinese bucko\nnamed Avaric. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to improve your grades at this late date, with the exams almost\nover and the examiners half-crocked themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the grades,\u201d said Boq. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand it yet.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re off to the pub, we\u2019re off to the pub,\u201d chanted some boys who, it seemed, had gotten a\nhead start. \u201cFuck Boq, the ale is waiting, and it\u2019s already aged enough!\u201d\n\u201cWhich pub, then, maybe I\u2019ll join you in an hour,\u201d Boq said, sitting firmly back in his chair and\nnot lifting his feet to the footstool, as he knew that this might incite his classmates to hoist him to\ntheir shoulders and carry him off with them for an evening of debauchery. His smallness seemed to\ninspire such banditry. Feet square on the floor made him look more planted, he figured.\n\u201cThe Boar and Fennel,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a new witch performing. They say she\u2019s hot.\nShe\u2019s a Kumbric Witch.\u201d\n\u201cHah,\u201d said Boq, unconvinced. \u201cWell, go on and get a good view. I\u2019ll come along when I can.\u201d\nThe boys rambled away, rattling doors of other friends, knocking aslant the portraits of old boys\nnow grown into august patrons. Avaric stood in the archway and waited a minute longer. \u201cWe might\nditch some\nof the boors and take a select few of us off to the Philosophy Club,\u201d he said enticingly. \u201cLater\non, I mean. It\u2019s the weekend, after all.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Avaric, go take a cold shower,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cYou admitted you were curious. You did. So why not an end-of-semester treat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ever said I was curious. I\u2019m curious about death, too, but I can wait to find out,\nthank you. Get lost, Avaric. Better go catch up with your friends. Enjoy the Kumbric antics, which by\nthe way I expect is false advertising. Kumbric Witch talents went out hundreds of years ago. If\nindeed they ever existed.\u201d\nAvaric turned up the second collar of his tunic-jacket. The inside was lined with a deep red\nvelvet plush. Against his elegant shaven neck the lining seemed like a single ribbon of privilege. Boq\nfound himself, once again, making mental comparisons between himself and handsome Avaric, and\ncoming up-well, coming up short. \u201cWhat, Avaric,\u201d he said, as impatient with himself as he was with\nhis friend.\n\u201cSomething has happened to you,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cI\u2019m not that dull. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cTell me to mind my own business, tell me to go flick myself, to piss off, go on, say it, but don\u2019t\ntell me nothing\u2019s wrong. For you\u2019re not that good a liar, and I\u2019m not that stupid. Even for a dissipated\nGillikinese of decaying nobility.\u201d His expression was soft, and Boq, momentarily, was tempted. His\nmouth opened as he thought of what to say, but at the sound of bells in Ozma Towers, chiming the\nhour, Avaric\u2019s head turned just a fraction. For all his concern, Avaric wasn\u2019t entirely here. Boq\nclosed his mouth, thought some more, and said, \u201cCall it Munchkinlander stolidity. I won\u2019t lie,\nAvaric, you\u2019re too good a friend to lie to. But there\u2019s nothing to say now. Now go on and enjoy\nyourself. But be careful.\u201d He was about to add a word of warning against the Philosophy Club, but\nchecked it. If Avaric was annoyed enough, then Boq\u2019s nannyish worrying might backfire and goad\nAvaric into going there.\nAvaric came forward and kissed him on both cheeks and on the forehead, an upper-class\nnorthern custom that always made Boq profoundly ill at ease. Then with a wink and a dirty gesture,\nhe disappeared.\nBoq\u2019s room looked out over a cobblestoned alley, down which Avaric\n\n\fand his cronies were swooping and weaving. Boq stood back, in the shadows, but needn\u2019t have\nworried; his friends weren\u2019t thinking of him now. They had made it through the halfway point in their\nexams and had a breather for a couple of days. After the exams, the campus would lie vacant except\nfor the more befuddled of the professors and the poorer of the boys. Boq had lived through this\nbefore. He preferred study, however, to scrubbing old manuscripts with a five-haired reck-fur brush,\nwhich was what he would be employed to do in the Three Queens library all summer long.\nAcross the alley ran the bluestone wall of a private stable, attached to some mansion house a\nfew streets away on a fashionable square. Beyond the stable roof you could see the rounded tops of a\nfew fruit trees, in the kitchen garden of Crage Hall, and above them glowed the lancet windows of\nthe dormitories and classrooms. When the girls forgot to draw their drapes- which was astoundingly\noften-you could see them in various stages of undress. Never the whole body naked, of course; in that\ncase he would have looked away, or told himself sternly that he had better. But the pinkness and\nwhiteness of underskirts and camisoles, the filminess of foundation garments, the rustle about the\nbustle and the fuss about the bust. It was an education in lingerie if nothing else. Boq, who had no\nsisters, merely looked.\nThe Crage Hall dormitory was just far enough away that he couldn\u2019t make out the individual\ngirls. And Boq was flushed with desire to see his heartthrob again. Damn! Double damn! He\ncouldn\u2019t concentrate. He\u2019d be sent down if he queered his exams! He\u2019d let down his father, old Bree,\nand his village, and the other villages.\nHell and hell. Life was hard and barley just wasn\u2019t enough. Boq found himself suddenly leaping\nover the footstool, grabbing his student cape, charging down the corridors, and plummeting around\nthe stone spiral stairs in the corner tower. He couldn\u2019t wait any more. He had to do something, and\nan idea had come to him.\nHe nodded to the porter on duty, turned left out of the gate, and hurried along the road, in the\ndusk avoiding as best he could the generous heaps of horse manure. At least with his classmates off\ngallivanting, he would make no fool of himself in their line of vision. There wasn\u2019t a soul left in\nBriscoe. So he turned left, then left again, and soon was pacing the alley by the stable. A rick of\ncordwood, the protruding edge of a swollen shutter, the iron bracket of a hoist. Boq was small but he\nwas nimble too,\nand with hardly a scrape of his knuckles he had swung himself to the tin gutter of the stable, and\nthen was scrabbling like a lake crab up the steeply pitched roof.\nAha! He might have thought of this weeks ago, months ago! But the night that all the boys would\nbe out celebrating, the night he could be sure he himself wouldn\u2019t be seen from Briscoe Hall: that\nwas tonight, and maybe only tonight. Some fate had insisted he resist Avaric\u2019s invitation out. For\nnow he was mounted on the stable roof, and the wind coursing through the wet leaves of the\ncranberry and pear trees made a soft fanfare. And there proceeded the girls into their hall-as if\nthey\u2019d been waiting in the corridor until he was properly positioned-as if they\u2019d known he was\ncoming!\nCloser up they were not, on the whole, as pretty.\nBut where was the one?\nAnd pretty or not, they were clear. The fingers they dove into clumps of satin bow, to untie\nthem, the fingers they peeled gloves off with, and worked cunning rows of forty miniature pearl\nbuttons with, the fingers they loaned to each other, at the inside laces and the private places that\ncollege boys knew only by mythology! The unexpected tufts of hair-how tender! How marvelously\nanimal like! His hands clenched and unclenched themselves, of their own accord, but hungry for\nwhat he hardly knew-and where was she?\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing up there?\u201d\n\n\fSo he slipped, of course, because he was startled, and because fate, having been so kind as to\naward him this ecstasy, retributively was going to kill him now. He lost his footing and grabbed for\nthe chimney but missed. Head over thighs he rolled out like a child\u2019s toy, smashed into the poking\nbranches of the damn pear tree, which probably saved his life, breaking his fall. He landed with a\nthud on a bed of lettuces, and the wind was loudly knocked out of him, mortifyingly so, through all\navailable orifices.\n\u201cOh, brilliant,\u201d said the voice. \u201cThe trees are dropping their fruits early this year.\u201d\nHe had a last, lost hope that the person speaking would be his love. He tried to look urbane,\nthough his spectacles had bounced somewhere.\n\u201cHow do you do,\u201d he said uncertainly, sitting up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I intended to arrive.\u201d\nBarefoot and aproned, she came out from behind an arbor of pink Pertha grapes. It wasn\u2019t she, it\nwasn\u2019t the one. It was the other one. He could tell even without his glasses. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d he said,\ntrying not to sound devastated.\nShe had a colander with baby grapes in it, the sour ones used in spring salads. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d\nshe said, coming closer. \u201cI know you.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Boq, at your service.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean Master Boq, in my lettuces.\u201d She picked up his spectacles from the runner beans,\nand handed them back.\n\u201cHow are you, Miss Elphie?\u201d\n\u201cI am not as tart as a grape and not as squished as a lettuce,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you, Master\nBoq?\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said, \u201cconsiderably embarrassed. Am I going to get in trouble here?\u201d\n\u201cI can arrange it if you like.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to the effort. I\u2019ll let myself out the way I came in.\u201d He looked up at the pear tree.\n\u201cPoor thing, I\u2019ve splintered some good-size limbs.\u201d\n\u201cPity the poor tree. Why would you do that to it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was startled,\u201d he said, \u201cand I had a choice: either flip myself like a wood nymph\nthrough the leaves. Or else just climb quietly down on the other side of the stable, into the street, and\ngo back to my life. Which would you choose?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the question,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always learned that the first thing to do is deny the\nquestion\u2019s validity. Myself, being startled, I would neither climb quietly streetward, nor would I trip\nnoisily treeward and lettuce bound. I would turn myself inside out to make myself lighter, I would\nhover until the air pressure outside me had stabilized. Then I would let the underside of my skin\nsettle, one toe at a time, back on the roof.\u201d\n\u201cAnd would you then reverse your skin?\u201d he said, entertained.\n\u201cDepends on who was standing there and what they wanted, and whether I minded. Also\ndepends on what color the underside of my skin turns out to be. Never having reversed myself, you\nknow, I can\u2019t be sure. I always thought it might be horrid to be pink and white like a piglet.\u201d\n\u201cIt often is,\u201d said Boq. \u201cEspecially in the shower. You feel like an\nunderdone-\u201d But he stopped. The nonsense was becoming too personal. \u201cI do beg your pardon,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI startled you and I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cYou were looking at the tops of the fruit trees, examining the new growth, I assume?\u201d she said,\namused.\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he answered coldly.\n\u201cDid you see the tree of your dreams?\u201d\n\u201cThe tree of my dreams is of my dreams, and I don\u2019t speak of that to my friends nor to you,\nwhom I hardly know.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh, but you know me. We were in a child play set together, you reminded me when we met\nlast year. Why, we\u2019re nearly brother and sister. You can certainly describe your favorite tree to me,\nand I\u2019ll tell you if I know where she grows.\u201d\n\u201cYou mock me, Miss Elphie.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that I don\u2019t mean to do, Boq.\u201d She used his name without the honorific in a gentle way,\nas if to underscore her comment about their being like siblings. \u201cI suspect you want to know about\nMiss Galinda, the Gillikinese girl you met at Madame Morrible\u2019s poetry slaughter last autumn.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you do know me better than I thought.\u201d He sighed. \u201cCould I hope she thinks of me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you could hope,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIt would be more efficient to ask her and have done\nwith it. At least you\u2019d know.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re a friend of hers, aren\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to rely on what I know or not,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cor what I say I know. I could be\nlying. I could be in love with you, and betray my roomie by lying about her-\u201c\n\u201cShe\u2019s your roomie?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very surprised at that?\u201d\n\u201cWell-no-just-just pleased.\u201d\n\u201cThe cooks will be wondering what dialogues with the asparagus I\u2019m having now,\u201d Elphaba\nsaid. \u201cI could arrange to bring Miss Galinda here some evening if you like. Sooner rather than later,\nso as to kill your joy the more neatly and entirely. If that is what\u2019s to happen,\u201d she said, \u201cbut as I say,\nhow do I know? If I can\u2019t predict what we\u2019ll have for pudding, how can I predict someone\u2019s\naffections?\u201d\nThey set a date for three nights hence, and Boq thanked Elphaba fervently, shaking her hand so\nhard his spectacles jounced on his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re a dear old friend, Elphie, even if I haven\u2019t seen you\nin fifteen years,\u201d he said, giving her back her name without its honorific. She withdrew beneath the\nboughs of the pear trees and disappeared down the walkway. Boq found his way out of the kitchen\ngarden and back to his room, and reviewed his books again, but the problem wasn\u2019t solved, no, not\nsolved. It was exacerbated. He couldn\u2019t concentrate. He was still awake to hear the noisy\nclatterings, the hushings, the crashings, and the muttered ballatherings, when the drunken boys\nreturned to Briscoe Hall.\nAvaric had left for the summer, once the exams were done, and Boq either had flimflammed his\nway through or disgraced himself, in which case there was little to lose now. This first rendezvous\nwith Galinda might be the last. Boq bothered with his clothes more than usual, and got an opinion on\nhow to fix his hair from the new look in the cafes (a thin white ribbon around the crown of his head,\npulling his hair straight from the nub, so that it burst into curls beneath, like froth exploding from an\noverturned basin of milk). He cleaned his boots several times over. It was too warm for boots but he\nhad no evening slippers. Make do, make do.\nOn the appointed evening he retraced his way and, on the stable roof, found that a fruit picker\u2019s\nladder had been left leaning up against the wall, so he need not descend through the leaves like a\nvertiginous chimpanzee. He picked his way carefully down the first few rungs, then jumped manfully\nthe rest of the way, avoiding the lettuces this time. On a bench under the wormnut trees sat Elphaba,\nher knees drawn casually up to her chest and her bare feet flat on the seat of the bench, and Galinda,\nwhose ankles were crossed daintily and who hid behind a satin fan, and who was looking in the\nother direction anyway.\n\u201cWell, my stars and garters, a visitor,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cSuch a surprise.\u201d\n\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYour head looks like a hedgehog in shock, what did you do to yourself?\u201d said Elphaba. At\nleast Galinda turned to see, but then she disappeared behind the fan again. Could she be so nervous?\n\n\fCould her heart be faint?\n\u201cWell I am part Hedgehog, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Boq. \u201cOn my grandfather\u2019s side. He ended\nup as cutlets for Ozma\u2019s retinue one hunting season, and a tasty memory for all. The recipe is handed\ndown in the family, pasted into the picture album. Served with cheese and walnut sauce. Mmmm.\u201d\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Elphaba. She put her chin on her knees. \u201cReally Hedgehog?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was a fancy. Good evening, Miss Galinda. It was good of you to agree to meet me\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cThis is highly improper,\u201d said Gallinda. \u201cFor a number of reasons, as you well know, Master\nBoq. But my roomie would give me no rest until I said yes. I can\u2019t say that I am pleased to see you\nagain.\u201d\n\u201cOh, say it, say it, maybe it\u2019ll make it true,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cTry it out. He\u2019s not so bad. For a\npoor boy.\u201d\n\u201cI am pleased that you are so taken with me, Master Boq,\u201d said Miss Galinda, working at\ncourtesy. \u201cI am flattered.\u201d She clearly was not flattered, she was humiliated. \u201cBut you must see that\nthere can be no special friendship between us. Apart from the matter of my feelings, there are too\nmany social impediments for us to proceed. I only agreed to come so that I could tell you this in\nperson. It seemed only fair.\u201d\n\u201cIt seemed only fair and it might be fun, too,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hanging around.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the issue of different cultures, to start,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cI know you are a\nMunchkinlander. I am a Gillikinese. I will need to marry one of my own. It is the only way, I\u2019m\nsorry\u201d-she lowered her fan and lifted her hand, palm out, to stop his protest-\u201cand furthermore you\nare a farmer, from the agricultural school, and I require a statesman or a banker from Ozma Towers.\nThis is just how things are. Besides,\u201d said Galinda, \u201cyou\u2019re too short.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about his subversion of custom by coming here this way, what about his silliness?\u201d said\nElphaba.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cThat\u2019ll do, Miss Elphaba.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019re too certain of yourself,\u201d said Boq. \u201cIf I may behold.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not so bold at all,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cyou\u2019re about as bold as tea made from used leaves.\nYou\u2019re embarrassing me with hanging back so. Come on, say something interesting. I\u2019m starting to\nwish I\u2019d gone to chapel.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting,\u201d said Boq. \u201cMiss Elphie, you\u2019ve done a wonderful thing to encourage\nMiss Galinda to meet me, but I must ask you to leave us alone to sort things out.\u201d\n\u201cNeither of you will understand what the other is saying,\u201d said Elphaba calmly. \u201cI\u2019m a\nMunchkinlander by birth anyway, if not by upbringing, and I\u2019m a girl by accident if not by choice.\nI\u2019m the natural arbiter between you two. I don\u2019t believe you can get along without me. In fact if I\nleave the garden you\u2019ll cease to decipher each other\u2019s language entirely. She speaks the tongue of\nRich, you speak Clotted Poor. Besides, I paid for this show by wheedling Miss Galinda for three\ndays running. I get to watch.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be so good of you to stay, Miss Elphaba,\u201d said Galinda, \u201cI require a chaperone when\nwith a boy.\u201d\n\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Elphaba said to Boq.\n\u201cThen if you must stay, at least let me talk,\u201d Boq said. \u201cPlease let me speak, just for a few\nminutes, Miss Galinda. What you say is true. You are highborn and I am common. You are\nGillikinese and I, Munchkinlander. You have a social pattern to conform to, and so do I. And mine\ndoesn\u2019t include marrying a girl too wealthy, too foreign, too expectant. Marriage isn\u2019t what I came\nhere to propose.\u201d\n\u201cSee, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t leave, this is just getting good,\u201d said Elphaba, but clamped her lips shut\n\n\fwhen they both glared at her.\n\u201cI came here to propose that we meet from time to time, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Boq. \u201cThat we meet as\nfriends. That, free of expectations, we come to know each other as dear friends. I do not deny that\nyou overwhelm me with your beauty. You are the moon in the season of shadowlight; you are the\nfruit of the candlewood tree; you are the phoenix in circles of flight-\u201c\n\u201cThis sounds rehearsed,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cYou are the mythical sea,\u201d he concluded, all his eggs in one basket.\n\u201cI\u2019m not much for poetry,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cBut you\u2019re very kind.\u201d She had seemed to perk up a\nlittle at the compliments. Anyway the fan was moving faster. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand the point of\nfriendship, as\nyou call it, Master Boq, between unmarried people of our age. It seems- distracting. I can see it\nmight lead to complications, especially as you confess to an infatuation I cannot hope to return. Not\nin a million years.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the age of daring,\u201d said Boq. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time we have. We must live in the present. We\nare young and alive.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if alive quite covers it,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThis sounds scripted to me.\u201d\nGalinda rapped Elphaba on the head with her fan, which folded smartly up and opened just as\nneatly again, an elegant practiced gesture that impressed all of them. \u201cYou\u2019re being tiresome, Miss\nElphie. I appreciate your company but I didn\u2019t request a running commentary. I\u2019m perfectly capable\nof deciding the merits of Master Boq\u2019s recital myself. Let me consider his stupid idea. Lurline\nabove, I can hardly hear myself think!\u201d\nLosing her temper, Galinda was prettier than ever. So that old saw was true, too. Boq was\nlearning so much about girls! Her fan was dropping. Was that a good sign? If she hadn\u2019t had some\naffection for him, would she have worn a dress with a neckline that dipped just a tad lower than he\nhad dared hope? And there was the essence of rose water on her. He felt a surge of possibility, an\ninclination to rub his lips on the place where her shoulder became her neck.\n\u201cYour merits,\u201d she was saying. \u201cWell, you\u2019re brave, I suppose, and clever, to have figured this\nout. If Madame Morrible ever found you here we\u2019d be in severe trouble. Of course you might not\nknow that, so scratch the bravery part. Just clever. You\u2019re clever and you\u2019re sort of, oh, well, I mean\nto look at-\u201c\n\u201cHandsome?\u201d suggested Elphaba. \u201cDashing?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fun to look at,\u201d decided Galinda.\nBoq\u2019s face fell. \u201cFun?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019d give a lot to achieve fun,\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cThe best I usually hope for is stirring, and when\npeople say that they\u2019re usually referring to digestion-\u201c\n\u201cWell, I might be all or none of the things you say,\u201d said Boq staunchly, \u201cbut you will learn that\nI am persistent. I will not let you say no to our friendship, Galinda. It means too much to me.\u201d\n\u201cBehold the male beast roaring in the jungle for his mate,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cSee how the female\nbeast giggles behind a shrub while she\norganizes her face to say, Pardon dear, did you say something?\u201d\n\u201cElphaba!\u201d they both cried at her.\n\u201cMy word, duckie!\u201d said a voice behind them, and all three turned. It was some middle-aged\nminder in a striped apron, her thinning gray hair twisted in a knot on her head. \u201cWhat are you getting\nyourself up to?\u201d\n\u201cAma Clutch!\u201d Galinda said. \u201cHow did you think to look for me here?\u201d\n\u201cThat Tsebra cook told me some yacky-yacky was going on out here. You think they\u2019re blind in\nthere? Now who is this? This don\u2019t look good at all, not to me.\u201d\n\n\fBoq stood. \u201cI am Master Boq of Rush Margins, Munchkinland. I am nearly a third-year fellow\nat Briscoe Hall.\u201d\nElphaba yawned. \u201cIs this show over?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am shocked! A guest don\u2019t get shown into the vegetable garden, so I guess you arrived\nuninvited! Sir, get yourself gone from here before I be calling the porters to remove you!\u201d\n\u201cOh, Ama Clutch, don\u2019t make a scene,\u201d said Galinda, sighing.\n\u201cHe\u2019s hardly developed enough to worry about,\u201d pointed out Elphaba. \u201cLook, he\u2019s still\nbeardless. And from that we can deduce-\u201c\nBoq said in a rush, \u201cPerhaps this is all wrong. I did not come here to be abused. Forgive me,\nMiss Galinda, if I have failed even to amuse you. As for you, Miss Elphaba\u201d-his voice was as cold\nas he could make it, and that was colder than he\u2019d ever heard it himself-\u201cI was wrong to have trusted\nin your compassion.\u201d\n\u201cWait and see,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWrong takes an awful long time to be proven, in my experience.\nMeanwhile, why don\u2019t you come back sometime?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no second time to this,\u201d said Ama Clutch, tugging at Galinda, who was proving as\nsedentary as set cement. \u201cMiss Elphaba, shame on you for encouraging this scandal.\u201d\n\u201cNothing here has been perpetrated but badinage, and bad badinage at that,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cMiss Galinda, you\u2019re mighty stubborn there. You\u2019re planting yourself in the vegetable garden for\ngood in the hopes that this Boy Visitation might occur again? Have we misread your interest?\u201d\nGalinda stood at last with some dignity. \u201cMy dear Master Boq,\u201d she said, as if dictating, \u201cit\nwas ever my intention to dissuade you from pursuing me, in romantic attachment or even in\nfriendship, as you put it. I had\nnot meant to bruise you. It is not in my nature.\u201d At this Elphaba rolled her eyes, but for once\nkept her mouth shut, perhaps because Ama Clutch had dug her fingernails into Elphaba\u2019s elbow. \u201cI\nwill not deign to arrange another meeting like this. As Ama Clutch reminds me, it is beneath me.\u201d\nAma Clutch hadn\u2019t exactly said that, but even so, she nodded grimly. \u201cBut if our paths cross in a\nlegitimate way, Master Boq, I will do you the courtesy at least of not ignoring you. I trust you will be\nsatisfied with that.\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Boq with a smile, \u201cbut it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now good evening,\u201d said Ama Clutch on behalf of them all, and steered the girls away.\n\u201cFresh dreams, Master Boq, and don\u2019t come back!\u201d\n\u201cMiss Elphie, you were horrible,\u201d he heard Galinda say, while Elphaba twisted around and\nwaved good-bye with a grin he could not clearly read.\nSo the summer began. Since he passed the exams, Boq was free to plan one last year at Briscoe\nHall. Daily he hid himself over to the library at Three Queens, where under the watchful eye of a\ntitanic Rhinoceros, the head archival librarian, he sat cleaning old manuscripts that clearly weren\u2019t\nlooked at more than once a century. When the Rhino was out of the room, he had flighty\nconversations with the two boys on either side of him, classic Queens boys, full of gibbering gossip\nand arcane references, teasing and loyal. He enjoyed them when they were in good spirits, and he\ndetested their sulks. Crope and Tibbett. Tibbett and Crope. Boq pretended confusion when they got\ntoo arch or suggestive, which seemed to happen about once a week, but they backed off quickly. In\nthe afternoons they would all take their cheese sandwiches by the banks of the Suicide Canal and\nwatch the swans. The strong boys at crew, coursing up and down the canal for summer practice,\nmade Crope and Tibbett swoon and fall on their faces in the grass. Boq laughed at them, not\nunkindly, and waited for fate to deliver Galinda back into his path.\nIt wasn\u2019t too long a wait. About three weeks after their vegetable garden liaison, on a windy\nsummer morning, a small earthquake caused some minor damage in the Three Queens library, and the\n\n\fbuilding had to be closed for some patching. Tibbett, Crope, and Boq took their sandwiches, with\nsome beakers of tea from the buttery, and they flopped down\nat their favorite place on the grassy banks of the canal. Fifteen minutes later, along came Ama\nClutch with Galinda and two other girls.\n\u201cI do believe we know you,\u201d said Ama Clutch as Galinda stood demurely a step behind. In\ncases such as these it was the servant\u2019s duty to elicit names from the strangers in the group, so that\nthey might greet each other personally. Ama Clutch registered out loud that they were Masters Boq,\nCrope, and Tibbett, meeting Misses Galinda, Shenshen, and Pfannee. Then Ama Clutch moved a few\nfeet away to allow the young people to address one another.\nBoq leaped up and gave a small bow, and Galinda said, \u201cAs in line with my promise, Master\nBoq, may I enquire how you\u2019re keeping?\u201d\n\u201cVery well, thank you,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cHe\u2019s ripe as a peach,\u201d said Tibbett.\n\u201cHe\u2019s downright luscious, from this angle,\u201d said Crope, sitting a few steps behind, but Boq\nturned and glared so fiercely that Crope and Tibbett were chastened, and fell into a mock sulk.\n\u201cAnd you, Miss Galinda?\u201d continued Boq, searching her well-composed face. \u201cYou are well?\nHow thrilling to see you in Shin for the summer.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t the right thing to say. The better\ngirls went home for the summer, and Galinda as a Gillikinese must feel it deeply that she was stuck\nhere, like a Munchkinlander or a commoner! The fan came up. The eyes went down. The Misses\nShenshen and Pfannee touched her shoulders in mute sympathy. But Galinda sallied on.\n\u201cMy dear friends the Misses Pfannee and Shenshen are taking a house for the month of\nHighsummer on the shores of Lake Chorge. A little fantasy house near the village of Neverdale. I\u2019ve\ndecided to make my holiday there instead of taking that tiresome trek back to the Pertha Hills.\u201d\n\u201cHow refreshing.\u201d He saw the beveled edges of her lacquered fingernails, the moth-colored\neyelashes, the glazed and buffed softness of cheek, the sensitive tuck of skin just at the cleft of her\nupper lip. In the summer morning light, she was dangerously, inebriatingly magnified.\n\u201cSteady,\u201d said Crope, and he and Tibbett jumped up and they each caught Boq by an elbow. He\nthen remembered to breathe. He couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say though, and Ama Clutch was\nturning her handbag around and around in her hand.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve got jobs,\u201d said Tibbett, to the rescue. \u201cThe Three Queens library. We\u2019re\nhousekeeping the literature. We\u2019re the cleaning maids of culture. Are you working, Miss Galinda?\u201d\n\u201cI should think not,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cI need a rest from my studies. It has been a harrowing year,\nharrowing. My eyes are still tired from reading.\u201d\n\u201cHow about you girls?\u201d said Crope, outrageously casual. But they only giggled and demurred\nand inched away. This was their friend\u2019s encounter, not theirs. Boq, regaining his composure, could\nfeel the group beginning to shift itself into motion again. \u201cAnd Miss Elphie?\u201d he enquired, to hold\nthem there. \u201cHow is your roomie?\u201d\n\u201cHeadstrong and difficult,\u201d said Galinda severely, for the first time speaking in a normal voice,\nnot the faint social whisper. \u201cBut, thank Lurline, she\u2019s got a job, so I get some relief. She\u2019s working\nin the lab and the library under our Doctor Dillamond. Do you know of him?\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Dillamond? Do I know of him?\u201d said Boq. \u201cHe\u2019s the most impressive biology tutor in\nShiz.\u201d\n\u201cBy the by,\u201d said Galinda, \u201che\u2019s a Goat.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes. I wish he would teach us. Even our professors acknowledge his prominence.\nApparently, years ago, back in the reign of the\nRegent, and before, he used to be invited annually to lecture at Briscoe\nHall. But the restrictions changed even that, so I\u2019ve never really met him.\n\n\fJust to see him at that poetry evening, last year, so briefly, was a treat-\u201c\n\u201cWell he does go on,\u201d said Galinda. \u201cBrilliant he may be, but he has no sense of when he\u2019s\nbecome tedious. Anyway, Miss Elphie\u2019s hard at work, doing something or other. She will go on\nabout it, too. I think it\u2019s contagious!\u201d\n\u201cWell, a lab, it breeds things,\u201d said Crope.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Tibbett, \u201cand incidentally may I add that you\u2019re every bit as lovely as Boq gushes\nyou are. We\u2019d put it down to an overactive imagination born of affectional and physical frustration-\u201c\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Boq, \u201cbetween your Miss Elphie and my erstwhile friends here, we have no\nreal hope of friendship at all. Shall we organize a duel and kill each other instead? Count off ten\npaces, turn and shoot? It would save so much bother.\u201d\nBut Galinda didn\u2019t approve of such joking. She nodded in a dismissive way, and the group of\nfemales moved out along the graveled path, following the curve of the canal. Miss Shenshen was\nheard to say in a deep, breathy voice, \u201cOh, my dear, he is sweet, in a toylike way.\u201d\nThe voice faded out, Boq turned to rail at Crope and Tibbett, but they fell to tickling him and\nthey all collapsed in a heap on the remains of their lunch. And since there was no hope in changing\nthem, Boq abandoned the impulse to correct his friends. Really, what difference did their callow\nbanter make if Miss Galinda found him so impossible?\nA week or two later, on his afternoon off, Boq took himself in to Railway Square. He lingered\nat a kiosk, staring. Cigarettes, ersatz love charms, naughty drawings of women undressing, and\nscrolls painted with lurid sunsets, overladen with one-line inspirational slogans. \u201cLurline Lives on\nWithin Each Heart.\u201d \u201cSafe Keep the Wizard\u2019s Laws, and the Wizard\u2019s Laws Will Keep You Safe.\u201d\n\u201cI Pray to the Unnamed God That Justice Will Walk Abroad in Oz.\u201d Boq noted the variety: the\npagan, the authoritarian, and the old-fashioned unionist impulses.\nBut nothing directly sympathetic to the royalists, who had gone underground in the sixteen harsh\nyears since the Wizard had first wrested power from the Ozma Regent. The Ozma line had been\nGillikinese originally, and surely there were active pockets of resistance to the Wizard? But Gillikin\nhad, in fact, thrived under the Wizard, so the royalists kept mum. Besides, everyone had heard the\nrumors of strict court action against turncoats and peristrophists.\nBoq bought a broadsheet published out of the Emerald City-several weeks old, but it was the\nfirst he\u2019d seen in some time-and he settled down at a cafe. He read about the Emerald City Home\nGuard suppressing some Animal dissenters, who were making a nuisance of themselves in the palace\ngardens. He looked for news of the provinces, and found a filler about Munchkinland, which\ncontinued experiencing near-drought conditions; occasional thunderbursts would drench the ground,\nbut the water would run off or sink uselessly into the clay. They said that hidden subterranean lakes\nunderlay the Vinkus region, that water resources there could serve the whole of Oz. But the idea of a\ncanal system across the entire country made everyone laugh. The expense! There was great\ndisagreement between the Eminences and the Emerald City as to what was to be done.\nSecession, thought Boq seditiously, and looked up to see Uphaba, alone, without even a nanny\nor Ama, standing over him.\n\u201cWhat a delicious expression you have on your face, Boq,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more\ninteresting than love.\u201d\n\u201cIt is love, in a way,\u201d said Boq, then remembered himself, and leaped to his feet. \u201cWon\u2019t you\njoin me? Please, take a seat. Unless you\u2019re worried about being unchaperoned.\u201d\nShe sat down, looking a bit etiolated, and allowed him to call for a cup of mineral tea. She had\na parcel in brown paper and string under her arm. \u201cA few trinkets for my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s\nlike Miss Galinda, she loves the fancy outside of things. I found a Vinkus shawl in the bazaar, red\nroses on a black background, with black and green fringe. I\u2019m sending it to her, and a pair of striped\n\n\fstockings that Ama Clutch knitted for me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a sister,\u201d he said. \u201cWas she in the play group we were in together?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s three years younger,\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cShe\u2019ll come to Crage Hall before long.\u201d\n\u201cIs she as difficult as you are?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s difficult in a different way. She\u2019s crippled, pretty severely, is my Nessarose, so she\u2019s a\nhandful. Even Madame Morrible doesn\u2019t quite know the extent of it. But by then I\u2019ll be a third-year\ngirl and will have the nerve to stand up to the Head, I guess. If anything gives me nerve, it\u2019s people\nmaking life hard for Nessarose. Life is already hard enough for her.\u201d\n\u201cIs your mama raising her?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is dead. My father is in charge, nominally.\u201d\n\u201cNominally?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s religious,\u201d said Elphaba, and made the circling palms gesture that indicated you could\ngrind millstone against millstone all you liked, but there wasn\u2019t any quern in the land that could\nproduce flour if there was no grain to grind.\n\u201cIt sounds very hard for you all. How did your mama die?\u201d\n\u201cShe died in childbirth, and this is the end of the personal interview.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about Doctor Dillamond. I hear you\u2019re working for him.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about your amusing campaign for the heart of Galinda the Ice Queen.\u201d\nBoq really wanted to hear about Doctor Dillamond, but was derailed by Elphaba\u2019s remark. \u201cI\nwill keep on, Elphie, I will! When I see her I\u2019m so smitten with longing, it\u2019s like fire in my veins. I\ncan\u2019t speak, and the things I think about are like visions. It\u2019s like dreaming. It\u2019s like floating in your\ndreams.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t dream.\u201d\n\u201cTell me, is there any hope? What does she say? Does she ever even imagine that her feelings\nfor me might change?\u201d\nElphaba sat with her two elbows on the table, her hands clasped in front of her face, her two\nforefingers leaning against each other and against her thin, grayish lips. \u201cYou know, Boq,\u201d she said,\n\u201cthe thing is I have become fond of Galinda myself. Behind her starry-eyed love of herself there is a\nmind struggling to work. She does think about things. When her mind is really working, she could, if\nled, think on you-even, I suspect, somewhat fondly. I suspect. I don\u2019t know. But when she slides back\ninto herself, I mean into the girl who spends two hours a day curling that beautiful hair, it\u2019s as if the\nthinking Galinda goes into some internal closet and shuts the door. Or as if she\u2019s in hysterical retreat\nfrom things that are too big for her. I love her both ways, but I find it odd. I wouldn\u2019t mind leaving\nmyself behind if I could, but I don\u2019t know the way out.\u201d\n\u201cI propose you\u2019re being hard on her, and you\u2019re certainly too forward,\u201d said Boq sternly.\n\u201cWere she sitting here I think she\u2019d be astounded to hear you speak so freely.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to behave as I think a friend should behave. Granted, I haven\u2019t had much\npractice.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I question your friendship with me, If you consider Miss Galinda your friend too, and if\nthat\u2019s how you tear a friend apart in her absence.\u201d\nThough Boq was irritated, he found that this was a more lively discussion than the conventional\npatter he and Galinda had so far exchanged. He didn\u2019t want to burn Elphaba off with criticism. \u201cI\u2019m\nordering you another mineral tea,\u201d he said, in an authoritative voice, his father\u2019s voice in fact, \u201cand\nthen you can tell me about Doctor Dillamond.\u201d\n\u201cSkip the tea, I\u2019m still nursing this one and you have no more money than I do, I bet,\u201d said\nElphaba, \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you about Doctor Dillamond. Unless you are too affronted at the slice and\nangle of my opinions.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cPlease, perhaps I am wrong,\u201d said Boq. \u201cLook, it\u2019s a nice day, we\u2019re both off the campus.\nHow do you come to be out alone, by the way? Is your escape sanctioned by Madame Morrible?\u201d\n\u201cTake a guess about that,\u201d she said, \u201cOnce it was clear that you could come and go from Crage\nHall by way of the vegetable garden and the roof of the adjacent stable, I decided I could too. I\u2019m\nnever missed.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard for me to believe,\u201d said he, daringly, \u201cfor you\u2019re not the kind who blends into the\nwoodwork. Now tell me about Doctor Dillamond. He\u2019s my Idol.\u201d\nShe sighed, and set the package down on the table at last, and settled in for a long chat. She told\nhim about Doctor Dillamond\u2019s work in natural essences, trying to determine by scientific method\nwhat the real differences were between animal and Animal tissue, and between Animal and human\ntissue. The literature on the matter, she had learned from doing the legwork herself, was all couched\nin unionist terms, and pagan terms before that, and they didn\u2019t hold up to scientific scrutiny. \u201cDon\u2019t\nforget Shiz University was originally a unionist monastery,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cso despite the anythinggoes attitude among the educated elite, there are still bedrocks of unionist bias.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a unionist,\u201d said Boq, \u201cand I don\u2019t see the conflict. The Unnamed God is\naccommodating to many ranges of being, not just human. Are you talking about a subtle bias against\nAnimals, interwoven into early unionist tracts, and still in operation today?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly what Doctor Dillamond thinks. And he\u2019s a unionist himself. Explain that\nparadox and I\u2019d be glad to convert. I admire the Goat intensely. But the real interest of it to me is the\npolitical slant. If he can isolate some bit of the biological architecture to prove that there isn\u2019t any\ndifference, deep down in the invisible pockets of human and Animal flesh-that there\u2019s no difference\nbetween us-or even among us, if you take in animal flesh too-well, you see the implications.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Boq, \u201cI don\u2019t think I do.\u201d\n\u201cHow can the Banns on Animal Mobility be upheld if Doctor Dillamond can prove,\nscientifically, that there isn\u2019t any inherent difference between humans and Animals?\u201d\n\u201cOh, now that\u2019s a blueprint for an impossibly rosy future,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThink, Boq. On what grounds could the Wizard possibly\ncontinue to publish those Banns?\u201d\n\u201cHow could he be persuaded not to? The Wizard has dissolved the Hall of Approval\nindefinitely. I don\u2019t believe, Elphie, that the Wizard is open to entertaining arguments, even by as\naugust an Animal as Doctor Dillamond.\u201d\n\u201cBut of course he must be. He\u2019s a man in power, it\u2019s his job to consider changes in knowledge.\nWhen Doctor Dillamond has his proof, he\u2019ll write to the Wizard and begin to lobby for change. No\ndoubt he\u2019ll do his best to let Animals the land over know what he\u2019s intending, too. He isn\u2019t a fool.\u201d\n\u201cWell I didn\u2019t say he was a fool,\u201d said Boq. \u201cBut how close do you think he is to getting firm\nevidence?\u201d\n\u201cI am a student handmaid,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand what he means. I\u2019m only a\nsecretary, an amanuensis-you know he can\u2019t write things himself, he can\u2019t manage a pen with his\nhoofs. I take dictation and I file and I dash to the Crage Hall library and look things up.\u201d\n\u201cBriscoe Hall library would be a better place to hunt for that kind of material,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cEven Three Queens, where I work this summer, has stacks of documents from the monks\u2019\nobservations of animal and vegetable life.\u201d\n\u201cI know I am not traditionally presented,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cbut I believe on the grounds of being a\ngirl I am excluded from the Briscoe Hall library. And on the grounds of being an Animal so too, now\nat least, is Doctor Dillamond. So those valuable resources are off limits to us.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Boq carelessly, \u201cif you knew exactly what you wanted . I have access to the stacks\nin both collections.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAnd when the good Doctor is finished ferreting out the difference between Animals and\npeople, I will propose he apply the same arguments to the differences between the sexes,\u201d said\nElphaba. Then she registered what Boq had said, and stretched out her hand, almost as if to touch\nhim. \u201cOh Boq. Boq. On behalf of Doctor Dillamond, I accept your generous offer of help. I\u2019ll get the\nfirst list of sources to you within the week. Just leave my name out of it. I don\u2019t care so much about\nincurring Horrible Morrible\u2019s wrath against myself, but I don\u2019t want her taking out her annoyance on\nmy sister, Nessarose.\u201d\nShe downed the last of her tea, gathered her parcel, and had sprung up almost before Boq could\npull himself to his feet. Various customers, lingering over their elevenses with their own broadsheets\nor novellas, looked up at the ungainly girl pushing out the doors. As Boq settled back down, hardly\nyet registering what he had gotten himself into, he realized, slowly but thoroughly, that this morning\nthere were no Animals taking their morning tea in here. No Animals at all.\nIn years to come-and Boq would live a long life-he would remember the rest of the summer as\nscented with the must of old books, when ancient script swam before his eyes. He sleuthed alone in\nthe musty stacks, he hovered over the mahogany drawers lined with vellum manuscripts. All season\nlong, it seemed, the lozenge-paned windows between bluestone mullions and transoms misted over\nagain and again with flecks of small but steady rain, almost as brittle and pesky as sand. Apparently\nthe rain never made it as far as Munchkinland-but Boq tried not to think about that.\nCrope and Tibbett were coerced into researching for Doctor Dillamond, too. At first they had to\nbe dissuaded from going about their forays in costumes of disguise-fake pince-nez, powdered wigs,\ncloaks with high collars, all to be found in the well-stocked locker of the Three Queens Student\nTheatrical and Terpsichorean Society. But when convinced of the seriousness of the mission, they\nfell to with gusto. Once a week they met Boq and Elphaba in the cafe in Railway Square. Elphaba\nshowed up, during these misty weeks, entirely swathed in a brown cloak with a hood and veil that\nhid all but her eyes. She wore long, frayed gray gloves that she boasted buying secondhand from a\nlocal undertaker, cheap for having been used in funeral services. She sheathed her bamboo-pole legs\nin a double thickness of cotton stocking. The first time Boq saw Elphaba like this, he said, \u201cI just\nbarely manage to convince Crope and Tibbett to lose the espionage drag, and you come in looking\nlike the original Kumbric Witch.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t dress for your approval, boys,\u201d she said, shucking her cloak and folding it inside out so\nthat the wet wool never touched her. On the\noccasion when another care patron would come through, shaking water off an umbrella,\nElphaba always recoiled, flinching if she was caught by even a scattering of drops.\n\u201cIs that religious conviction, Elphie, that you keep yourself so dry?\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you before, I don\u2019t comprehend religion, although conviction is a concept I\u2019m\nbeginning to get. In any case, someone with a real religious conviction is, I propose, a religious\nconvict, and deserves locking up.\u201d\n\u201cHence,\u201d observed Crope, \u201cyour aversion to all water. Without your knowing it, it might be a\nbaptismal splash, and then your liberty as a free-range agnostic would be curtailed.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were too self-absorbed to notice my spiritual pathology,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cNow,\nboys, what\u2019ve we got today?\u201d\nEvery time, Boq thought: Would that Galinda were here. For the casual camaraderie that grew\nup among them during these weeks was so refreshing-a model of ease and even wit. Against\nconvention they had dropped the honorifics. They interrupted one another and laughed and felt bold\nand important because of the secrecy of their mission. Crope and Tibbett cared little about Animals\nor the Banns-they were both Emerald City boys, sons, respectively, of a tax collector and of a palace\nsecurity advisor-but Elphaba\u2019s passionate belief in the work enlivened them. Boq himself grew more\n\n\finvolved, too. He imagined Galinda drawing her chair up with them, losing her upper-crust reserve,\nallowing her eyes to glow with a shared and secret purpose.\n\u201cI thought I knew all the shapes of passion,\u201d Elphaba said one bright afternoon. \u201cI mean,\ngrowing up with a unionist minister for a father. You come to expect that theology is the fundament\non which all other thought and belief is based. But boys!-this week, Doctor Dillamond made some\nsort of a scientific breakthrough. I\u2019m not sure what it was, but it involved manipulating lenses, a pair\nof them, so he could peer at bits of tissue that he had laid on a transparent glass and backlit by\ncandlelight. He began to dictate, and he was so excited that he sang his findings; he composed arias\nout of what he was seeing! Recitatives about structure, about color, about the basic shapes of organic\nlife. He has a horrible sandpapery voice, as you might imagine for a Goat;\nbut how he warbled! Tremolo on the annotations, vibrato on the interpretations, and sostenuto\non the implications: long, triumphant open vowels of discovery! I was sure someone would hear. I\nsang with him, I read his notes back to him like a student of musical composition.\u201d\nThe good Doctor was emboldened by his findings, and he required that their digging become\nmore and more focused. He did not want to announce any breakthroughs until he had figured out the\nmost politically advantageous way to present them. Toward the end of the summer the push was on to\nfind Lurlinist and early unionist disquisitions on how the Animals and the animals had been created\nand differentiated. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of uncovering a scientific theory by a prescientific company of\nunionist monks or pagan priests and priestesses,\u201d explained Elphaba. \u201cBut Doctor Dillamond wants\nto authenticate the way our ancestors thought about this. The Wizard\u2019s right to impose unjust laws\nmay be better challenged if we know how the old codgers explained it to themselves.\u201d\nIt was an interesting exercise.\n\u201cIn one form or another, we all know some of the origin myths that predate the Oziad,\u201d said\nTibbett, throwing his blond bangs back with a theatrical flourish. \u201cThe most coherent one has our\ndear putative Fairy Queen Lurline on a voyage. She was tired of travel in the air. She stopped and\ncalled from the desert sands a font of water hidden deep beneath the earth\u2019s dry dunes. The water\nobeyed, in such abundance that the land of Oz in all its febrile variety sprang up almost instantly.\nLurline drank herself into a stupor and went for a long rest on the top of Mount Runcible. When she\nawoke, she relieved herself copiously, and this became the Gillikin River, running around the vast\ntracts of the Great Gillikin Forest and skirting through the eastern edges of the Vinkus, and coming to\na stop at Restwater. The animals were terricolous and thus of a lower order than Lurline and her\nretinue. Don\u2019t look at me like that, I know what that word means-I looked it up. It means living on or\nnear the ground.\n\u201cThe animals had come into their being as rolled clots of earth dislodged from the exuberant\nplant growth. When Lurline let loose, the animals thought the raging stream was a flood, sent to\ndrown their fresh new world, and they despaired of their existence. In a panic they flung themselves\ninto the torrent and attempted to swim through Lurline\u2019s urine. Those who became intimidated and\nturned back remained animals,\nbeasts of burden, slaughtered for flesh, hunted for fun, counted as profit, admired as innocent.\nThose who swam on and made it to the farther shore were given the gifts of consciousness and\nlanguage.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a gift, to be able to imagine your own death,\u201d muttered Crope.\n\u201cThus, Animals. Convention, as long ago as history can remember, divides the animals and\nAnimals.\u201d\n\u201cBaptism by piss,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIs that a subtle way both to explain the talents of Animals\nand to denigrate them at the same time?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of the animals who drowned?\u201d asked Boq. \u201cThey must have been the real losers.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOr the martyrs.\u201d\n\u201cOr the ghosts who live underground now and stop up the water supply so the fields of\nMunchkinland dry up today.\u201d\nThey all laughed and had more tea brought to the table.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found some later scriptures with a more unionist slant,\u201d Boq said. \u201cThey tell a story that I\nguess would be derived from the pagan narrative, but it has been cleaned up some. The flood,\noccurring sometime after creation and before the advent of humankind, wasn\u2019t a massive piss by\nLurline, but the sea of tears wept by the Unnamed God on the god\u2019s only visit to Oz. The Unnamed\nGod perceived the sorrow that would overwhelm the land throughout time, and bawled in pain. The\nwhole of Oz was a mile deep in saltwater tides. The animals kept afloat by means of the odd log, the\nuprooted tree. Those who swallowed enough of the tears of the Unnamed God were imbued with a\nfulsome sympathy for their kin, and they began to construct rafts from the flotsam. They saved their\nkind out of mercy, and from their kindness they became a new, sentient lot: the Animals.\u201d\n\u201cAnother kind of baptism, from within,\u201d said Tibbett. \u201cIngestion. I like it.\u201d\n\u201cBut what of the pleasure faith?\u201d said Crope. \u201cCan a witch or a sorcerer take an animal and,\nthrough a spell, create an Animal?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve been looking into,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThe pleasure fathers-the fatherssay that if anything-Lurline or the Unnamed God-could have done it once, magic could do it again.\nThey even hint that the original distinction between Animals and animals was a Kumbric Witch\nspell, so strong and enduring it has never worn off. This\na thing as a Kumbric Witch, let alone if there ever was. Myself, I think it\u2019s\na part of the Lurlinist cycle that\u2019s gotten detached and developed independently. Arrant\nnonsense. We have no proof that magic is so strong-\u201c\n\u201cWe have no proof that god is so strong,\u201d interrupted Tibbett.\n\u201cWhich strikes me as being as good an argument against god as it is against magic,\u201d said\nElphaba, \u201cbut never mind that. The point is, if it is an enduring Kumbric spell, centuries old, it may\nbe reversible. Or it may be perceived to be reversible, which is just as bad. In the interim, while\nsorcerers are at work experimenting with charms and spells, the Animals lose their rights, one by\none. Just slowly enough so that it\u2019s hard to see as a coherent political campaign. It\u2019s a dicey\nscenario, and one that Doctor Dillamond hasn\u2019t figured out-\u201c\nAt this point Elphaba hitched the loose part of her cloak up over her head, and disappeared into\nthe shadows of Its folds. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Boq, but she put a finger to her lips. Crope and Tibbett, as if\non cue, launched into some silly banter about their professional goals of being abducted by pirates of\nthe desert and made to dance the fandango dressed only in slave shackles. Boq saw nothing amiss: A\ncouple of clerks reading the racing forms, some genteel ladies with their lemonades and novellas, a\ntiktok creature buying coffee beans by the pound, a parody of an old professor figuring out some\ntheorem by arranging and rearranging some sugar cubes along the edge of his butter knife.\nA few minutes later, Elphaba relaxed. \u201cThat tiktok thing works at Crage Hall. I think it\u2019s called\nGrommetik. Usually it shadows Madame Morrible like a lovesick puppy. I don\u2019t think it saw me.\u201d\nBut she was too jittery to continue the conversation, and after she made sure their next\nassignments were clear, the crew disbanded into the misty streets.\nTwo weeks before Briscoe Hall reconvened for the new semester, Avaric returned from his\nhome, the seat of the Margreave of Tenmeadows. He was bronzed with summer leisure and eager for\nfun. He mocked Boq for having struck up friendships with boys from Three\nQueens, and under other circumstances Boq would probably have let his new alliance with\nCrope and Tibbett lapse. But they were all engaged in Doctor Dillamond\u2019s research now, and Boq\njust put up with Avaric\u2019s taunting.\n\n\fElphaba remarked one day that she had had a letter from Galinda, away with her friends on\nLake Chorge. \u201cCan you believe it, she proposed I take a coach and come visit for a weekend,\u201d said\nElphaba. \u201cShe must really be bored out of her mind with those society girls.\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s society herself, how could she be bored?\u201d asked Boq.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me to explain the nuances of that circle,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cbut I suspect that our Miss\nGalinda isn\u2019t quite as society as she makes out.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Elphie, when are you going?\u201d asked Boq.\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThis work is too important.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see the letter.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cBring it to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she needs you. She always seems to need you.\u201d\n\u201cShe needs me?\u201d Elphaba laughed, coarsely, loudly. \u201cWell I know you\u2019re besotted and I feel\nsomewhat responsible. I\u2019ll show you the letter next week. But I\u2019m not going to go just to give you a\nvicarious thrill, Boq. Friend or no friend.\u201d\nThe next week she unfolded the letter.\nMy dear Miss Elphaba,\nI am bade to write to you by my hostesses the Misses Pfannee of Pfann Hall and Shenshen of the\nMinkos Clan. We are having a lovely summer at Lake Chorge. The air is calm and sweet and all is\nas pleasant as anything. If you would like to visit us for three or four days before school begins, we\nknow you have been hard at work all summer and so. A little change. If you would like to come no\nneed to write if you would like to visit. Just arrive by coach at Neverdale and come by foot or hire a\nhansom cab, it\u2019s just a mile or two by the bridge. The house is dear, covered in roses and ivy, it s\ncalled the Caprice-in-the-Pines. Who wouldn\u2019t love it here! I do hope you can come! I do very\nspecially hope so for reasons I dare not write. I cannot advise you as to chaperones as .Alina\nClutch is already here and so is Ama and Ama Vimp. You can decide. We hope for long hours of\namusing conversation. Ever your loving friend,\nMiss Galinda\nof the Arduennas of the Upland\n33 Highsummer, midday\nat \u201cCaprice-in-the-Pines\u201d\n\u201cBut you must go!\u201d Boq cried. \u201cLook how she writes to you!\u201d\n\u201cShe writes like someone who doesn\u2019t write very often,\u201d Elphaba observed.\n\u201cI do hope you can come!\u2019 she says. She needs you, Elphie. I insist that you go!\u201d\n\u201cOh you do? Why don\u2019t you go then?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cI hardly can go without having been invited.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s easy enough. I\u2019ll write and tell her to invite you.\u201d Elphaba reached for a pencil in\nher pocket.\n\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Miss Elphaba,\u201d said Boq sternly. \u201cThis must be taken seriously.\u201d\n\u201cYou are lovesick and deluded,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like your retreating back to \u2018Miss\nElphaba\u2019 to punish me for disagreeing with you. Besides, I can\u2019t go. I have no chaperone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be your chaperone.\u201d\n\u201cHah! As if Madame Morrible would allow that!\u201d\n\u201cWell-how about\u201d-Boq tossed it around-\u201chow about my friend Avaric? He\u2019s the son of a\nmargreave. He\u2019s spotless by virtue of his station. Even Madame Momble would quail before a\nmargreave\u2019s son.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMadame Morrible wouldn\u2019t quail before a hurricane. Besides, have you no concern for me? I\ndon\u2019t feel like traveling with this Avaric.\u201d\n\u201cElphie,\u201d said Boq, \u201cyou owe me. I\u2019ve been helping you out all summer, and I\u2019ve had Crope\nand Tibbett helping too. Now you have to pay me back. You ask Doctor Dillamond for a few days\noff, and I\u2019ll ask Avaric, who is bursting to do something. The three of us will go to Lake Chorge.\nAvaric and I will rent a room in an inn, and we\u2019ll stay a very short time. Just long enough to make\nsure that Miss Galinda is all right.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s you I\u2019m worried about, not her,\u201d said Elphaba, and Boq could see that he had won.\nMadame Momble would not release Elphaba in the care of Avaric. \u201cYour dear father would\nnever forgive me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am not the Horrible Morrible you think of me. Oh yes, I know\nyour little pet names for me, Miss Elphaba. Amusing and juvenile! I am concerned for your welfare.\nAnd with all your hard work all summer, I see that you have grown, oh, shall we say, verdigrisian?\nSo I shall make a compromise proposal. Provided that you can convince Master Avaric and Master\nBoq to travel with you and my own little Grommetik, whom I will loan in your care and to care for\nyou, I shall permit your little summer fun.\u201d\nElphaba, Boq, and Avaric rode in the coach, and Grommetik was made to ride on top with the\nluggage. Elphaba met Boq\u2019s eyes from time to time, grimacing, but she ignored Avaric, to whom she\nhad taken an instant dislike.\nWhen he had finished with the pages of his racing form, Avaric teased Boq about this trip. \u201cI\nshould have known when I left for the summer that you were mooning about in the throes of love!\nYou developed this serious set of chin, it misled me. I thought it was consumption at least. You\nshould have come out with me that night before I left! A visit to the Philosophy Club would have\nbeen just what the doctor ordered.\u201d\n\n\fBoq was mortified to have such a dive mentioned in the presence of a female. But Elphaba\nseemed to take no offense. Perhaps she didn\u2019t know what it was. He tried to steer Avaric away from\nthe subject.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know Miss Galinda, but you will find her charming,\u201d he said. \u201cI guarantee that.\u201d\nAnd she will probably find you charming, he thought, a bit late in the day. But he was even willing to\nlive with that, if it was the price of helping Galinda out of a tricky situation.\nAvaric was regarding Elphaba with contempt. \u201cMiss Elphaba,\u201d he said formally, \u201cdoes your\nname imply any elf blood in your background?\u201d\n\u201cWhat a novel idea,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIf there were, I suppose my limbs would be as brittle as\nuncooked pasta, and come apart with the slightest of pressure. Would you care to apply some force?\u201d\nShe proffered a forearm, green as a spring limeberry. \u201cDo, I beg you, so we can settle this question\nfor once, for all. We shall conclude that the relative force you need to break my arm-as opposed to\nother arms you have broken-is proportionate to the relative amount of human versus elfin blood in\nmy veins.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly will not touch you,\u201d said Avaric, managing to say many things at once.\n\u201cThe elf in the self regrets,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWere you to have dismembered me, I might have\nbeen posted back to Shin in small pieces and been spared the tedium of this forced holiday. And this\ncompany.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Elphie.\u201d Boq sighed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good start, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s swell,\u201d said Avaric, glaring.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think friendship required this much,\u201d snapped Elphaba to Boq. \u201cI was better off\nbefore.\u201d\nIt was late afternoon by the time they arrived in Neverdale and settled at the inn, and made their\nway by foot along the lake to Caprice-in-the-Pines.\nTwo older women were in the sunlight by the portico, shelling string beans and wristwrenchers.\nThe one Boq recognized was Ama Clutch, Galinda\u2019s chaperone; the other must be the minder of\nMiss Shenshen or Miss Pfannee. They started at the sight of the procession coming up the drive, and\nAma Clutch leaned forward, the string beans spilling out of her lap. \u201cWell, I never,\u201d she said as they\ndrew near, \u201cit\u2019s Miss Elphie herself. My uncle\u2019s whiskers. I never did.\u201d She pulled herself to her\nfeet and clasped Elphaba into her arms. Elphaba stood as stiff as a plaster figure.\n\u201cGive us a minute to be catching our breath, duckies,\u201d said Ama Clutch. \u201cWhatever in the\nblameless heaven are you doing here, Miss Elphaba? It don\u2019t seem possible.\u201d\n\u201cI have been invited by Miss Galinda,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cand my fellow travelers here insisted\nthey wanted to accompany me. So I find myself compelled to accept.\u201d\n\u201cI know nothing of this,\u201d said Ama Clutch. \u201cMiss Elphaba, let me take that heavy reticule and\nfind you something clean to put on. You must be frayed from the voyage. You gentlemen will be\nstaying in the village, of course. But for now, the girls are in the summerhouse at the edge of the\nlake.\u201d\nThe travelers made their way along a path interrupted with stone steps at the steeper parts.\nGrommetik took longer at steps and was left behind, and no one was inclined to stay and lend a hand\nto a figure with such a hard skin and clockwork thoughts. Skirting the final growth of holly flight\nbushes, they came upon the gazebo.\nIt was a skeleton house of unstripped logs, six sides open to the breezes, with a fretwork of\narabesquing twigs, and Lake Chorge a mighty field of blue beyond. The girls were sitting on steps\nand in wicker chairs, and Ama Clipp was lost in some small work involving three needles and many\ncolors of thread.\n\u201cMiss Galinda!\u201d broke out Boq, needing his to be the first voice heard.\n\n\fThe girls raised their heads. In evanescent summer frocks, free of hoops and bustles, they\nlooked like birds about to scatter.\n\u201cHoly terror!\u201d said Galinda, her jaw dropping. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not decent!\u201d shrieked Shenshen, drawing attention to her unshod feet and pale exposed\nankles.\nPfannee bit one corner of her lip and tried to revise her smirk into a smile of welcome.\n\u201cI am not staying for long,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cBy the way, girls, this is\nMaster Avaric, the Margreave Descending from Tenmeadows, Gillikin.\nAnd this is Master Boq from Munchkinland. They\u2019re both at Briscoe\nHall. Master Avaric, as if you can\u2019t tell by the lovesick expression in Boq\u2019s\nface, this is Miss Galinda of the Arduennas, and Miss Shenshen and Miss\nPfannee, who can outline their own pedigrees perfectly well.\u201d\n\u201cBut how enchanting, and how naughty,\u201d said Miss Shenshen. \u201cMiss Elphaba who-never-givesus-the-time-of-day, you have redeemed yourself for all time by this pleasant surprise. How do you\ndo, gentlemen.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d stammered Galinda, \u201cbut why are you here? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cI am here because I stupidly mentioned your invitation to Master Boq, who saw it as a sign\nfrom the Unnamed God that we should visit.,\u2019\nBut at this Miss Pfannee could control herself no longer, and fell on the floor of the gazebo,\nwrithing in laughter. \u201cWhat,\u201d said Shenshen, \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cBut what invitation are you talking about?\u201d asked Galinda.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to show you,\u201d said Elphaba. For the first time since Boq had known her, she\nlooked confused. \u201cSurely I don\u2019t need to bring it out-\u201c\n\u201cI believe I have been set up to be mortified,\u201d said Galinda, glaring at the helpless Pfannee. \u201cI\nam being humiliated for sport. This is not funny, Miss Pfannee! I have half a mind to-to kick you!\u201d\nJust then Grommetik made it around the edge of the holly flight bush. The sight of the stupid\ncopper thing teetering on the edge of a stone step made Shenshen collapse against a column and join\nPfannee in uncontrollable laughter. Even Ama Clipp smiled to herself as she began to put away her\nmaterials.\n\u201cBut what is going on?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cWere you born to plague me?\u201d Galinda said tearfully to her roomie. \u201cDid I ask for your\nassociation?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d said Boq. \u201cDon\u2019t, Miss Galinda, please don\u2019t say another word. You\u2019re upset.\u201d\n\u201cI-wrote-the-letter,\u201d heaved Pfannee between her gales of laughter. Avaric began to chuckle,\nand Elphaba\u2019s eyes went wide and a little unfocused.\n\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t write to invite me to visit here?\u201d said Elphaba to Galinda.\n\u201cOh, dear no, I did not,\u201d said Galinda. In her anger she was beginning to regain some control,\neven though, Boq guessed, damage had been done for good. \u201cMy darling Miss Elphaba, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave dreamed of exposing you to such thoughtless cruelties as these girls perpetrate on each other\nand on me for sheer amusement. Besides, you have no place In a setting like this.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve been invited,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cMiss Pfannee, you wrote that letter instead of Miss\nGalinda?\u201d\n\u201cYou ate it up!\u201d chortled Pfannee.\n\u201cWell this is your home and I accept your invitation even if it was written under false\npretenses,\u201d Elphaba said, her voice evenly matter-of-fact as she stared into Miss Pfannee\u2019s\nnarrowed eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go up and unpack my bags.\u201d\nShe strode away. Only Grommetik followed. The air went stale with things unsaid. By and by\n\n\fPfannee\u2019s hysteria grew quieter, and she merely snorted and wheezed, and then grew still, lying\nvaporishly and unkempt on the flagstone floor of the gazebo.\n\u201cWell you all needn\u2019t pierce me with your sniffy attitudes,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt was a joke.\u201d\nElphaba stayed in her room for a day. Galinda came and went with a dinner. On occasion she\nwould stay for a few minutes. So the boys took to swimming and rowing on the lake with the girls.\nBoq tried to fan in himself an interest in Shenshen or Pfannee, who certainly were coquettish enough.\nBut they both seemed besotted with Avaric.\nAt last Boq cornered Galinda on the porch and pleaded with her to talk with him. She agreed, a\nmeasure of her demure demeanor returning, and they sat a short distance apart on a swing. \u201cI suppose\nI\u2019m to blame for not seeing through that ruse,\u201d said Boq. \u201cElphie wasn\u2019t inclined to accept that\ninvitation. I made her.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this Elphie?\u201d said Galinda. \u201cWhere has propriety gone this summer, I ask you?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become friends.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can promise to have gathered that. Why did you make her accept an invitation? Didn\u2019t\nyou know I\u2019d never write such a thing?\u201d\n\u201cHow should I know that? You\u2019re her roomie.\u201d\n\u201cBy executive order of Madame Momble, not by choice! I care to have that remembered!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know. You seem to get along.\u201d\nShe sniffed, and curled a lip, but it seemed to be a remark to herself.\nBoq continued, \u201cIf you\u2019ve been woefully humiliated, why don\u2019t you leave?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I shall,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m considering. Elphaba says that to leave is to admit defeat. Yet\nif she comes out of her hiding and begins to trip along with the rest of you-and me-the joke will be\nunbearable. They don\u2019t like her,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cWell neither do you, I\u2019d say!\u201d said Boq, in an explosive whisper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different, I have a right and a reason,\u201d she retorted. \u201cI am forced to put up with her! And\nall because my stupid Ama stepped on a rusty nail in the railway station in Frottica and missed the\norientation! My whole academic career up in smoke because of my Ama\u2019s carelessness! When I\u2019m a\nsorcerer I\u2019ll have my revenge on her for that!\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that Elphaba brought us together,\u201d said Boq softly. \u201cI\u2019m closer to her and so I\u2019m\ncloser to you.\u201d\nGalinda seemed to give up. She leaned her head back on the velvet cushions of the swing and\nsaid, \u201cBoq, you know despite myself I think you\u2019re a little sweet. You\u2019re a little sweet and you\u2019re a\nlittle charming and you\u2019re a little maddening and you\u2019re a little habit-forming.\u201d\nBoq held his breath.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re little!\u201d she concluded. \u201cYou\u2019re a Munchkin, for god\u2019s sake!\u201d He kissed her, he\nkissed her, he kissed her, little by little by little.\nThe next day Elphaba, Galinda, Boq, and Grommetik-and of course Ama Clutch-made the sixhour trip back to Shin with fewer than a dozen remarks among them. Avaric stayed behind to disport\nhimself with Pfannee and Shenshen. The pestering rain took up at the outskirts of Shin, and the august\nfacades of Crage Hall and Briscoe Hall were nearly obliterated with mist by the time they were, at\nlast, home.\nBoq didn\u2019t have time or inclination to remark on his romance when he saw Crope and Tibbett.\nThe Rhino librarian, having paid scant attention to the boys or their progress all summer, had\nsuddenly cot-toned on to how little had been achieved, and was all rheumatic buffs and watchful\neyes. The boys chattered little, they brushed and cleaned vellum and rubbed finfoot oil on leather\nbindings and polished brass clasps. Only a few days left of this tedium.\nOne afternoon Boq let his eye drift down the codex he was handling. Usually he worked without\n\n\fattention to the subject matter of the materials, but his eye was drawn to the bright red paint applied\nin the illustration. It was a picture-maybe four, five hundred years old?\u2013of a Kumbric Witch. Some\nmonk\u2019s visionary zeal or anxiety about magic had inspired his brush. The Witch stood on an isthmus\nconnecting two rocky lands, and on either side of her stretched patches of cerulean blue sea, with\nwhite-lipped waves of astonishing vigor and particularity. The Witch held in her hands a beast of\nunrecognizable species, though it was clearly drowned, or nearly drowned. She cradled it in an arm\nthat, without attention to actual skeletal flexibility, lovingly encircled the beast\u2019s wet, spiky-furred\nback. With her other hand she was freeing a breast from her robe, offering suck to the creature. Her\nexpression was hard to read, or had the monk\u2019s hand smudged, or age and grime bestowed a sfumato\nsympathy? She was nearly motherly, with miserable child. Her look was inward, or sad, or\nsomething. But her feet didn\u2019t match her expression, for they were planted on the narrow strand with\nprehensile grip, apparent even through the silver-colored shoes, whose coin-of-the-realm brilliance\nhad first caught Boq\u2019s eye. Furthermore, the feet were turned out at ninety-degree angles to the shins.\nThey showed in profile as mirror images, heels clicked together and toes pointing in opposite\ndirections, like a stance in ballet. The gown was a hazy dawn blue. He guessed by the jeweled tones\nof the work that the document hadn\u2019t been opened in centuries.\nDramatically, or theologically, this image seemed some sort of a hybrid of the creation myths of\nthe Animals. Here were the flood waters, whether they derived from legends of Lurline or the\nUnnamed God, whether they were rising or sinking. Was the Kumbric Witch interfering with or\naccomplishing the ordained fate of the beasts? Though in a script too crabbed and archaic for Boq to\ndecipher, perhaps this document supported the fable of a Kumbric Witch spell that gave the Animals\nthe gifts of speech, memory, and remorse. Perhaps it merely refuted it, but glowingly. Any way you\nlooked at it there was the syncretism of myth, myth\u2019s happy appetite to engorge on narrative strains.\nMaybe this painting was the suggestion of some alarmed monk that the Animals received their\nstrengths through yet another sort of baptism, by nursing at the teat of the Kumbric Witch? Inducted\nthrough the milk of the Witch?\nSuch analysis wasn\u2019t his strong point. He had a hard enough time with the nutrients and common\npests of barley. He should do the unthinkable and deliver this actual scroll to Doctor Dillamond. It\nwould be valuable to know about.\nOr maybe, he thought as he hurried to meet Elphaba, the thing safely smuggled into the deep\npocket of his cape and out of the Three Queens library, maybe the Witch wasn\u2019t feeding the drenched\nanimal, but killing it? Sacrificing it to stay the floods?\nArt was way beyond him.\nHe had run into Ama Clutch in the bazaar and begged her to deliver a note to Elphaba. The good\nwoman seemed more sympathetic than usual to him; was Galinda singing his praises in the privacy of\nher room?\nIt was his first time to see the funny green jumping bean since amying back in Shin. And there\nshe was, on time, arriving at the cafe as requested, in a gray ghost of a dress, with a knitted over pull\nfraying at the sleeves, and a man\u2019s umbrella, big and black and lance like when rolled up. Elphaba\nsat down with a graceless fromp, and examined the scroll. She looked at it more closely than she\nwould bring herself to look at Boq. But she listened to his exegesis, and thought it feeble. \u201cWhat\nprevents this from being the Fairy Queen Lurline?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWell, the accoutrements of glamour are missing. I mean the golden nimbus of hair. The\nelegance. The transparent wings. The wand.\u201d\n\u201cThose silver shoes are pretty gaudy.\u201d She munched on a dry biscuit.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a portrait of determination or-what do I mean-genesis. It looks reactive\nrather than proactive. That figure is at the very least confused, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging around Crope and Tibbett too long, go back to your barley,\u201d she said,\npocketing the thing. \u201cYou\u2019re getting vague and artsy. But I\u2019ll give it to Doctor Dillamond. I\u2019ll tell\nyou, he keeps making breakthroughs. This business of opposing lenses has opened up a whole new\nworld of corpuscular architecture. He let me look once, but I couldn\u2019t make out much except for\nstress and bias, color and pulse. He\u2019s very excited. The problem I see now is getting him to stop-I\nthink he\u2019s on the verge of founding a whole new branch of knowledge, and every day\u2019s findings\nprovoke a hundred new questions. Clinical, theoretical, hypothetical, empirical, even ontological, I\nguess. He\u2019s been staying up late at night in the labs. We can see his lights on when we pull the\ndrapes at night.\u201d\n\u201cWell, does he need anything more from us? I only have two days left in that library, and then\nschool starts.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t get him to focus. I think he\u2019s just putting together what he\u2019s got.\n\u201cHow about Galinda, then,\u201d he said, \u201cif we\u2019re done with academic espionage for the time\nbeing? How is she? Does she ask for me?\u201d\nElphaba allowed herself to look at Boq. \u201cNo. Galinda really hasn\u2019t\nsaid anything about you. To give you hope you don\u2019t deserve, I should add she\u2019s hardly said\nanything to me at all, either. She\u2019s in a heavy sulk.\u201d\n\u201cWhen will I see her again?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it mean that much to you?\u201d She smiled wanly. \u201cBoq, does she really mean that much to\nyou?\u201d\n\u201cShe is my world,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cYour world is too small if she is it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t criticize the sine of a world. I can\u2019t help it and I can\u2019t stop it and I can\u2019t deny it.\u201d\n\u201cI should say you look silly,\u201d she said, draining the last drops of lukewarm tea from her cup. \u201cI\nshould say you\u2019ll look back on this summer and cringe. She may be lovely, Boq-no, she is lovely, I\nagree-but you\u2019re worth a dozen of her.\u201d At his shocked expression she threw up her hands. \u201cNot to\nme! I don\u2019t mean me! Please, that stricken look! Spare me!\u201d\nBut he wasn\u2019t sure if he believed her. She gathered her things in a hurry and rushed out,\nknocking the spittoon over in a clatter, slicing her big umbrella right through someone\u2019s newspaper.\nShe didn\u2019t look both ways as she lunged across Railway Square and was nearly mowed down by an\nold Ox on a cumbersome tricycle.\nThe next time Boq saw Elphaba and Galinda, all thoughts of romance fled. It was in the small\ntriangular park outside the gate of Crage Hall. He had been just happening by, once again, this time\nwith Avaric in tow. The gates had opened and Ama Vimp had come flouncing out, face white and\nnose dripping, and a flurry of girls poured out after her. Among them were Elphaba and Galinda and\nShenshen and Pfannee and Milla. Free of their walls, the girls huddled in chattering circles, or stood\nbeneath the trees in shock, or hugged each other, and wailed, and wiped each other\u2019s eyes.\nBoq and Avaric hurried up to their friends. Elphaba had her shoulders high, like a cat\u2019s bony\nyoke, and hers was the only dry face. She stayed arm\u2019s length away from Galinda and the others. Boq\nlonged to take Galinda in his arms, but she didn\u2019t look at him more than once before diving her face\ninto Milla\u2019s thick-fur collar.\n\u201cWhat is it? What has happened?\u201d said Avaric. \u201cMiss Shenshen, Miss Pfannee?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too horrible,\u201d they cried, and Galinda nodded, and her nose ran messily along the shoulder\nseam of Milla\u2019s blouse. \u201cThe police are there, and a doctor, but it seems to be-\u201c\n\u201cWhat,\u201d said Boq, and turned to Elphaba. \u201cElphie what is it, what?\u201d\n\u201cThey found out,\u201d she said. Her eyes were glazed like old Shizian porcelain. \u201cSomehow the\nbastards found out.\u201d\n\n\fThe gate creaked open again, and petals of early autumn vine flowers, blue and purple, came\ndancing over the college wall. They hung, and stepped like butterflies, and fell slowly, as three\ncaped policemen and a doctor in a dark cap emerged carrying a stretcher. A red blanket had covered\nthe patient, but the wind that tossed the petals caught a corner of the blanket and pulled it back in a\ntriangular fold. The girls all shrieked and Ama Vimp ran forward to tuck the blanket down, but in the\nsunlight all had looked down and seen the twisted shoulders and back-thrown head of Doctor\nDillamond. His throat was still knotted with congealed ropes of black blood, where it had been slit\nas thoroughly as if he had wandered into an abattoir.\nBoq sat down, disgusted and alarmed, hoping he had not seen death, just a horrible treatable\nwound. But the police and doctor weren\u2019t hurrying, there was no reason to hurry now. Boq fell back\nagainst the wall, and Avaric, who had never seen the Goat before, held Boq\u2019s hands tightly with one\nhand and covered his own face with the other.\nBefore long Galinda and Elphaba sank down beside him, and there was some weeping, some\nlong weeping, before words could be spoken. At last Galinda told the story.\n\u201cWe went to bed last night-and Ama Clutch got up to pull the drapes closed. As she does. And\nshe looks down and says almost to herself, \u2018Well there\u2019s the lights on, Doctor Goat is at it again.\u2019\nThen she peers a little closer, down the yard, and says, \u2018Well now isn\u2019t that funny?\u2019 And I don\u2019t pay\nany attention, I\u2019m just sitting there staring, but Elphaba says, \u2018What\u2019s funny, Ama Clutch?\u2019 And Ama\nClutch just pulls the drape very tightly and says in a funny voice, \u2018Oh, nothing, my ducks. I\u2019ll just\nstep down to check and make sure everything\u2019s all right. As long as you girls are abed.\u2019 She says\ngood night and she leaves, and I don\u2019t know if she\ngoes down there or what, but we both fall asleep and in the morning she isn\u2019t there with the tea.\nShe always gets the tea! She always does!\u201d\nGalinda gave herself to tears, sinking and then raising herself to her knees and trying to tear her\nblack silk gown with the white epaulets and the white bobbing. Elphaba, dry-eyed as a desert stone,\ncontinued.\n\u201cWe waited until after breakfast, but then we went to Madame Morrible\u2019s,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cand\ntold her that we didn\u2019t know where Ama Clutch was. And Madame Morrible said that Ama Clutch\nhad had a relapse during the night and was recovering in the infirmary. She wouldn\u2019t let us in to see\nher at first, but then when Doctor Dillamond didn\u2019t show up for our first lecture of the semester, we\nwandered over there and just pushed our way in. Ama Clutch was in a hospital bed. Her face looked\nfunny, like the last pancake of the batch, the way it goes all wrong. We said, \u2018Ama Clutch, Ama\nClutch, what has happened to you?\u2019 She didn\u2019t say anything even though her eyes were open. She\ndidn\u2019t seem to hear us. We thought maybe she was asleep or in shock, but her breathing was regular\nand her color was good even though her face seemed awry. Then as we were leaving she turned and\nshe looked at the bedside table.\n\u201cNext to a medicine bottle and a cup of lemon water there was a long rusty nail on a silver tray.\nShe reached a shaky hand out to the nail and picked it up and held it in her palm, tenderly, and she\ntalked to it. She said something like, \u2018Oh well then, I know you didn\u2019t mean to stab my foot last year.\nYou were only trying to get my attention. That\u2019s what misbehavior is all about, just a little extra\nloving being asked for. Well, don\u2019t you worry Nail, because I\u2019m going to love you just as much as\nyou need. And after I have a little nap you can tell me how you came to be holding up the platform of\nthe railway station at Frottica, for it seems quite a leap from your early years as a common hook for\na CLOSED FOR THE SEASON sign in that dingy hotel you were talking about.\u201d\nBut Boq could not listen to this blather. He could not take in the story of a live Nail while a\ndead Goat was being prayed over by hysterical faculty members. Boq could not listen to the sounds\nof the prayers for the repose of the Animal\u2019s spirit. He could not watch the departure of the corpse,\n\n\fwhen they trundled it away. For it had been clear, with a glimpse of the Goat\u2019s still face, that\nwhatever had given the doctor his enlivening character had already disappeared.\nThere was no doubt in the minds of anyone who had seen the corpse that the word, the correct\nword, was murder. The way the pelt about the neck had bunched up, caked together like an\nimproperly cleaned worker\u2019s paintbrush; the raw amber hollow in the eye. The official story was\nthat the doctor had broken a magnifying lens and stumbled against it, cutting an artery in the processbut nobody believed it.\nThe only one they could think of to ask, Ama Clutch, merely smiled when they came to visit,\nwith handfuls of pretty yellowing leaves or a plate of late Pertha grapes. She devoured the grapes\nand chatted with the leaves. It was an ailment no one had ever seen before.\nGlinda-for out of some belated apology for her initial rudeness to the martyred Goat, she now\ncalled herself as he had once called her- Glinda seemed to be stricken dumb before the fact of Ama\nClutch. Glinda wouldn\u2019t visit, nor discuss the poor woman\u2019s condition, so Elphaba sneaked in once\nor twice a day. Boq assumed that Ama Clutch suffered a passing malady. But after three weeks\nMadame Morrible began to make sounds of concern that Elphaba and Glinda-still roomies-had no\nchaperone. She suggested the common dormitory for them both. Glinda, who would no longer go to\nsee Madame Morrible on her own, nodded and accepted the demotion. It was Elphaba who came up\nwith a solution, mostly to salvage some shred of Glinda\u2019s dignity.\nThus it was that ten days later Boq found himself in the beer garden of the Cock and Pumpkins,\nwaiting for the midweek coach from the Emerald City. Madame Morrible didn\u2019t allow Elphaba and\nGlinda to join him, so he had to decide for himself which two of the seven passengers alighting were\nNanny and Nessarose. The deformities of Elphaba\u2019s sister\nwere well concealed, Elphaba had warned him; Nessarose could even descend from a carriage\nwith grace, providing the step was secure and the ground flat.\nHe met them, said hello. Nanny was a stewed plum of a woman, red and loose, her old skin\nlooking ready to trail off but for the tucks at the corners of the mouth, the fleshy rivets by the edges of\nthe eyes. More than a score of years in the badlands of Quadling Country had made her lethargic,\ncareless, and saturated with resentment. At her age she ought to have been allowed to nod off in\nsome warm chimney nook \u201cGood to see a little Munchkinlander,\u201d she murmured to Boq. \u201cIt\u2019s like the\nold times.\u201d Then she turned and said into the shadows, \u201cCome, my poppet.\u201d\nHad he not been warned, Boq wouldn\u2019t have taken Nessarose as Elphaba\u2019s sister. She was by\nno means green, or even blue-white like a genteel person with bad circulation. Nessarose stepped\nfrom the carriage elegantly, gingerly, strangely, sinking her heel to touch the iron step at the same\ntime as her toe. Walking as oddly as she did, she drew attention to her feet, which kept eyes away\nfrom the torso, at least at first.\nThe feet landed on the ground, driven there with a ferocious intention to balance, and Nessarose\nstood before him. She was as Elphaba had said: gorgeous, pink, slender as a wheat stalk, and\narmless. The academic shawl over her shoulders was cunningly folded to soften the shock.\n\u201cHello, good sir,\u201d she said, nodding her head very slightly. \u201cThe valises are on top. Can you\nmanage?\u201d Her voice was as smooth and oiled as Elphaba\u2019s was serrated. Nanny propelled\nNessarose gently toward the hansom cab that Boq had engaged. He saw that Nessarose did not move\nwell without being able to lean backward against a steadying hand.\n\u201cSo now Nanny has to see the girls through their schooling,\u201d said Nanny to Boq as they rode\nalong. \u201cWhat with their sainted mother in her waterlogged grave these long years, and their father off\nhis head. Well, the family always was bright, and brightness, as you know, decays brilliantly.\nMadness is the most shining way. The elderly man, the Eminent Thropp, he\u2019s still alive, and sensible\nas an old ploughshare. Survived his daughter and his granddaughter. Elphaba is the Thropp Third\n\n\fDescending. She\u2019ll be the Eminence one day. As a Munchkinlander, you know about such things.\u201d\n\u201cNanny don\u2019t gossip, it hurts my soul,\u201d Nessarose said.\n\u201cOh my pretty, don\u2019t you fret. This Boq is an old friend, or as good as,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cOut in the\nswamps of Quadling hell, my friend, we\u2019ve lost the art of conversation. We croak in chorus with\nwhat\u2019s left of the froggie folk.\u201d\n\u201cI intend to have a headache from shame,\u201d said Nessarose, charmingly.\n\u201cBut I knew Elphie when she was a small thing,\u201d said Boq. \u201cI\u2019m from Rush Margins in Wend\nHardings. I must\u2019ve met you too.\u201d\n\u201cPrimarily I preferred to reside at Coiwen Grounds,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cI was a mortal comfort to\nthe Lady Partra, the Thropp Second Descending. But occasionally I visited Rush Margins. So I may\nhave met you when you were young enough to run around without trousers.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you do,\u201d said Nessarose.\n\u201cThe name is Boq,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cThis is Nessarose,\u201d said Nanny, as if it were too painful for the girl to introduce herself. \u201cShe\nwas to come up to Shiz next year, but we have learned there\u2019s a problem with some Gillikinese\nminder going loopy. So Nanny is called to step in, and can Nanny leave her sweet? You see why\nnot.\u201d\n\u201cA sad mystery, we hope for improvement,\u201d said Boq.\nAt Crage Hall, Boq witnessed the reunion of the sisters, which was warm and gratifying.\nMadame Morrible had her Grommetik thing wheel out tea and brisks for the Thropp females, and for\nNanny, Boq, and Glinda. Boq, who had begun to worry about Glinda\u2019s retreat into silence, was\nrelieved to see Glinda cast a hard, appraising eye over the elegant dress of Nessarose. How could it\nbe, he wondered if Glinda was wondering, that two sisters should each be disfigured, and should\nclothe themselves so unlike? Elphaba wore the humblest of dark frocks; today she was in a deep\npurple, almost a black. Nessarose, balanced on a sofa next to Nanny, who assisted by lifting teacups\nand crumpling buttery bits of crumpet, was in green silks, the colors of moss, emerald, and\nyellowgreen roses. Green Elphaba, sitting on her other side and lending her support between the\nshoulders as she tilted her head back to sip her tea, looked like a fashion accessory.\n\u201cThe whole arrangement is highly unusual,\u201d Madame Morrible was saying, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have\nunlimited room to accommodate peculiarities,\nalas. We\u2019ll leave Miss Elphaba and Miss Galinda-Glinda is it now, dear? How novel-we\u2019ll\nleave those two old pals as they are, and we\u2019ll set you up, Miss Nessarose, with your Nanny in the\nadjoining room that poor old Ama Clutch had. It\u2019s small but you must think of it as cozy.\u201d\n\u201cBut when Ama Clutch recovers?\u201d asked Glinda.\n\u201cOh, but my dear,\u201d said Madame Morrible, \u201csuch confidence the young have! Touching, really.\u201d\nShe continued in a more steely voice. \u201cYou have already told me of the long-standing recurrence of\nthis unusual medical condition. I can only assume this has deteriorated into a permanent relapse.\u201d\nShe munched a biscuit in her slow, fishy way, her cheeks going in and out like the leather flaps of a\nbellows. \u201cOf course we can all hope. Not much more than that, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we can pray,\u201d Nessarose said.\n\u201cOh well yes, that,\u201d said the Head. \u201cThat goes without saying among people of good breeding,\nMiss Nessarose.\u201d\nBoq watched Nessarose and Elphaba both blush. Glinda excused herself and went away. The\nusual pang of panic Boq felt at her departure was softened by knowing he would see her again in life\nsciences next week, for, with the new prohibitions on Animal hiring, the colleges had decided to\ngive assembly lectures to all the students from all the colleges, at once. Boq would see Glinda at the\nfirst coeducation lecture ever held at Shiz. He couldn\u2019t wait.\n\n\fThough she had changed. She had surely changed.\nGlinda was changed. She knew it herself. She had come to Shiz a vain, silly thing, and she now\nfound herself in a coven of vipers. Maybe it was her own fault. She had invented a nonsense disease\nfor Ama Clutch, and Ama Clutch had come down with it. Was this proof of an inherent talent of\nsorcery? Glinda opted to specialize in sorcery this year, and accepted it as her punishment that\nMadame Morrible didn\u2019t change her roomie as promised. Glinda no longer cared. Beside Doctor\nDillamond\u2019s death, a lot of other matters now seemed insignificant.\nBut she didn\u2019t trust Madame Morrible either. Glinda had told nobody else that stupid and\nextravagant lie. So now she would no longer\nallow Madame Morrible so much as a finger hold into her life. And Glinda still didn\u2019t have the\nnerve to confess her unintentional crime to anyone. While she fretted, Boq, that pesky little flea, kept\nzizzing around her looking for attention. She was sorry she had let him kiss her. What a mistake!\nWell, all that was behind her now, that trembling on the edges of social disaster. She had seen the\nMisses Pfannee et cetera for what they were-shallow, self-serving snobs-and she would have no\nmore to do with them.\nSo Elphaba, no longer a social liability, had all the potential of becoming an actual friend. If\nbeing saddled with this broken doll of a baby sister didn\u2019t interfere too much. It was only with\nprodding that Glinda had gotten Elphaba to talk at all about her sister, so that Glinda might be\nprepared for Nessarose\u2019s arrival and the enlargement of their social circle.\n\u201cShe was born at Colwen Grounds, when I was about three,\u201d Elphaba had told her. \u201cMy family\nhad gone back to Colwen Grounds for a short stay. It was one of those times of intense drought. Our\nfather told us later, after our mother had died, that Nessarose\u2019s birth had coincided with a temporary\nresurgence of well water in the vicinity. They\u2019d been doing pagan dances and there was a human\nsacrifice.\u201d\nGlinda had stared at Elphaba, who sounded at once unwilling and offended.\n\u201cA friend of theirs, a Quadling glassblower. The crowd, incited by some rabble-rousing\npfaithers and a prophetic clock, fell on him and killed him. A man named Turtle Heart.\u201d Elphaba had\npressed the palms of her hands over the high uppers of her stiff black secondhand shoes, and kept her\neyes trained on the floor. \u201cI think that was why my parents became missionaries to the Quadling\npeople, why they never went back to Colwen Grounds or Munchkinland.\u201d\n\u201cBut your mother died in childbirth?\u201d said Glinda. \u201cHow could she have been a missionary?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t die for five years,\u201d said Elphaba, looking at the folds of her dress, as if the story\nwere an embarrassment. \u201cShe died when our younger brother was born. My father named him Shell,\nafter Turtle Heart, I think. So Shell and Nessarose and I lived the lives of gypsy children, slopping\naround from Quadling settlement to settlement with Nanny and our father, Frex. He preached, and\nNanny taught us and\nraised us up and kept house such as we ever had, which wasn\u2019t much. Meanwhile the Wizard\u2019s\nmen began draining the badlands to get at the ruby deposits. It never worked, of course. They\nmanaged to chase the Quadlings out and kill them, round them up in settlement camps for their own\nprotection and starve them. They despoiled the badlands, raked up the rubies, and left. My father\nwent barmy over it. There never were enough rubies to make it worth the effort; we still have no\ncanal system to run that legendary water from the Vinkus all the way cross-country to Munchkinland.\nAnd the drought, after a few promising reprieves, continues unabated. The Animals are recalled to\nthe lands of their ancestors, a ploy to give the farmers a sense of control over something anyway. It\u2019s\na systematic marginalizing of populations, Glinda, that\u2019s what the Wizard\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\u201cWe were talking about your childhood,\u201d said Glinda.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all part of it. You can\u2019t divorce your particulars from politics,\u201d Elphaba\n\n\fsaid. \u201cYou want to know what we ate? How we played?\u201d\n\u201cI want to know what Nessarose is like, and Shell,\u201d said Glinda.\n\u201cNessarose is a strong-willed semi-invalid,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cShe\u2019s very smart, and thinks she is\nholy. She has inherited my father\u2019s taste for religion. She isn\u2019t good at taking care of other people\nbecause she has never learned how to take care of herself. She can\u2019t. My father required me to babysit her through most of my childhood. What she will do when Nanny dies I don\u2019t know. I suppose I\u2019ll\nhave to take care of her again.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what a hideous prospect for a life,\u201d said Glinda, before she could stop herself.\nBut Elphaba only nodded grimly. \u201cI can\u2019t agree with you more,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAs for Shell-\u201d continued Glinda, wondering what fresh pain she might tread upon.\n\u201cMale, and white, and whole,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s now about ten, I guess. He\u2019ll stay at home and\ntake care of our father. He is a boy, just as boys are. A little dull, maybe, but he hasn\u2019t had the\nadvantages we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d prompted Glinda.\n\u201cEven for a short time,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cwe had a mother. Giddy, alcoholic, imaginative,\nuncertain, desperate, brave, stubborn, supportive\nwoman. We had her. Melena. Shell had no mother but Nanny, who did her best.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who was your mother\u2019s favorite?\u201d said Glinda.\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell that,\u201d said Elphaba casually, \u201cdon\u2019t know. Would have been Shell, probably, since\nhe\u2019s a boy. But she died without seeing him so she didn\u2019t even get that small consolation.\u201d\n\u201cYour father\u2019s favorite?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy,\u201d said Elphaba, jumping up and finding her books on her shelf, and getting\nready to run out and stop the conversation in its tracks. \u201cThat\u2019s Nessarose. You\u2019ll see why when you\nmeet her. She\u2019d be anyone\u2019s favorite.\u201d She skidded out of the room with no more than a brief flurry\nof green fingers, a good-bye.\nGlinda wasn\u2019t so sure she favored Elphaba\u2019s sister. Nessarose seemed so demanding. Nanny\nwas overly attentive, and Elphaba kept suggesting adjustments in their living arrangements to make\nthings perfect. Hitch the drapes to this angle instead of that, to keep the touch of the sun off\nNessarose\u2019s pretty skin. Can we have the oil lamp turned up high so Nessarose can read? Shhh, no\nchatting after hours; Nessarose has retired and she is such a light sleeper.\nGlinda was a bit awed by Nessarose\u2019s freaky beauty. Nessarose dressed well (if not\nextravagantly). She deflected attention from herself, though, by a system of little social tics-the head\nlowered in a sudden onslaught of devotion, the eyes batting. It was especially moving-and irritatingto have to wipe away a trickle of tears brought on by some epiphany in Nessarose\u2019s rich inner\nspiritual life of which bystanders could have no inkling. What did one say?\nGlinda began to retreat into her studies. Sorcery was being taught by a louche new instructor\nnamed Miss Greyling. She had a gushing respect for the subject but, it soon became apparent, little\nnatural ability. \u201cAt its most elemental a spell is no more than a recipe for change,\u201d she would flute at\nthem. But when the chicken she tried to turn into a piece of toast became instead a mess of used\ncoffee grounds cupped in a lettuce leaf, the students all made a mental note never to accept an\ninvitation to dine with her.\nIn the back of the room, creeping with pretend invisibility so that she might observe, Madame\nMorrible shook her head and clucked. Once\nor twice she could not stop herself from interfering. \u201cNo dab hand in the sorcerer\u2019s parlor I,\u201d\nshe would protest, \u201cyet surely Miss Greyling you\u2019ve omitted the steps to bind and convince? I\u2019m\nmerely asking. Let me try. You know I take a special pleasure in our training of sorceresses.\u201d\nInevitably Miss Greyling sat on what was left of a previous demonstration, or dropped her purse,\n\n\fcollapsing into a heap of shame and mortification. The girls giggled, and didn\u2019t feel that they were\nlearning much.\nOr were they? The benefit of Miss Greyling\u2019s clumsiness was that they were not afraid to try\nfor themselves. And she didn\u2019t stint at enthusiasm if a student managed to accomplish the day\u2019s task.\nThe first time Glinda was able to mask a spool of thread with a spell of invisibility, even for a few\nseconds, Miss Greyling clapped her hands and jumped up and down and broke a heel off her shoe. It\nwas gratifying, and encouraging.\n\u201cNot that I have any objection,\u201d said Elphaba one day, when she and Glinda and Nessarose\n(and, inevitably, Nanny) sat under a pearlfruit tree by the Suicide Canal. \u201cBut I have to wonder. How\ndoes the university get away with teaching sorcery when its original charter was so strictly\nunionist?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t anything inherently either religious or nonreligious about sorcery,\u201d said\nGlinda. \u201cIs there? There isn\u2019t anything inherently pleasure faithist about it either.\u201d\n\u201cSpells, changings, apparitions? It\u2019s all entertainment,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIt\u2019s theatre.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it can look like theatre, and in the hands of Miss Greyling it often looks like bad\ntheatre,\u201d admitted Glinda. \u201cBut the gist of it isn\u2019t concerned with application. It\u2019s a practical skill,\nlike-like reading and writing. It\u2019s not that you can, it\u2019s what you read or write. Or, if you\u2019ll excuse\nthe play on words, what you spell.\u201d\n\u201cFather disapproved mightily,\u201d Nessarose said, in the dulcet tones of the unflappably faithful.\n\u201cFather always said that magic was the sleight of hand of the devil. He said pleasure faith was no\nmore than an exercise to distract the masses from the true object of their devotion.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a unionist talking,\u201d said Glinda, not taking offense. \u201cA sensible opinion, if what you\u2019re\nup against is charlatans or street performers. But sorcery doesn\u2019t have to be that. What about the\ncommon witches up in the Glildcus? They say that they magick the cows they\u2019ve imported from\nMunchkinland so they don\u2019t go mooing over the edge of some\nprecipice. Who could ever afford to put a fence on every ledge there? The magic is a local\nskill, a contribution to community well-being. It doesn\u2019t have to supplant religion.\u201d\n\u201cIt may not have to,\u201d said Nessarose, \u201cbut if it tends to, then have we a duty to be wary of it?\u201d\n\u201cOh, wary, well, I\u2019m wary of the water I drink, it might be poisoned,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cThat\ndoesn\u2019t mean I stop drinking water.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s so big an issue,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI think sorcery is trivial. It\u2019s\nconcerned with itself mostly, it doesn\u2019t lead outward.\u201d\nGlinda concentrated very hard and tried to make Elphaba\u2019s leftover sandwich elevate outward\nover the canal. She only succeeded in exploding the thing in a small combustion of mayonnaise and\nshredded carrot and chopped olives. Nessarose lost her balance laughing, and Nanny had to prop her\nup again. Elphaba was covered in bits of food, which she picked off herself and ate, to the disgust\nand laughter of everyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s all effects, Glinda,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing ontologically\ninteresting about magic. Not that I believe in unionism either,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m an atheist and an\naspiritualist.\u201d\n\u201cYou say that to shock and scandalize,\u201d said Nessarose primly. \u201cGlinda, don\u2019t listen to a word\nof her. She always does this, usually to make Father irate.\u201d\n\u201cFather\u2019s not around,\u201d Elphaba reminded her sister.\n\u201cI stand in for him and I am offended,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to turn your nose up\nat unionism when you have been given a nose by the Unnamed God. It\u2019s quite funny, isn\u2019t it, Glinda?\nChildish.\u201d She looked spitting angry.\n\u201cFather\u2019s not around,\u201d said Elphaba again, in a tone that verged on the apologetic. \u201cYou needn\u2019t\nrush to public defense of his obsessions.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat you term his obsessions are my articles of faith,\u201d she said with a chilly clarity.\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not a bad sorceress, for a beginner,\u201d said Elphaba, turning to Glinda. \u201cThat was a\npretty good mess you made of my lunch.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Glinda said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pelt you with it. But I am getting better, aren\u2019t I?\nAnd out in public.\u201d\n\u201cA shocking display,\u201d Nessarose said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Father would have deplored about\nsorcery. The allure is all in the surface.\u201d\n\u201cI agree, it still tastes like olives,\u201d Elphaba said, finding a clump of black olive in her sleeve\nand holding it out on the tip of her finger to her sister\u2019s mouth. \u201cTaste, Nessa?\u201d\nBut Nessarose turned her face away and lost herself in silent prayer.\nA few days later Boq managed to catch Elphaba\u2019s eye at the break of their life sciences class,\nand they met up in an alcove off the main corridor. \u201cWhat do you think of this new Doctor Nikidik?\u201d\nhe asked.\n\u201cI find it hard to listen,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because I still want to hear Doctor Dillamond and\nI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone.\u201d On her face was a look of gray submission to impossible reality.\n\u201cWell that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m curious about,\u201d he said. \u201cYou told me all about Doctor\nDillamond\u2019s breakthrough. Do you know if his lab has been cleared out yet? Maybe there\u2019s\nsomething there worth finding. You took the notes for him, couldn\u2019t they be the basis of some\nproposal, or at least some further study?\u201d\nShe looked at him with a wiry, strong expression. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m not way ahead of you?\u201d\nshe asked. \u201cOf course I went tramping through there the day his body was found. Before anyone\ncould lace up the door with padlocks and binding spells. Boq, do you take me for a fool?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t take you for a fool, so tell me what you found,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHis findings are well hidden away,\u201d she said, \u201cand though there are colossal holes in my\ntraining, I am studying it on my own.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re not going to show me?\u201d He was shocked.\n\u201cIt was never your particular interest,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, until there\u2019s something to prove,\nwhat\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t think Doctor Dillamond was there yet.\u201d\n\u201cI am a Munchkinlander,\u201d he answered proudly. \u201cLook, Elphie, you\u2019ve more or less convinced\nme what the Wizard is up to. The confining of Animals back onto farms-to give the dissatisfied\nMunchkinlander farmers the impression he\u2019s doing something for them-and also to provide forced\nlabor for the sinking of useless new wells. It\u2019s vile. But this affects Wend Hardings and the towns\nthat sent me here. I have a right to\nknow what you know. Maybe we can figure it out together, work to make a change.\u201d\n\u201cYou have too much to lose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to take this on myself.\u201d\n\u201cTake what on?\u201d\nShe only shook her head. \u201cThe less you know the better, and I mean for your sake. Whoever\nkilled Doctor Dillamond doesn\u2019t want his findings made public. What kind of a friend would I be to\nyou if I put you at risk too?\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of friend would I be to you if I didn\u2019t insist?\u201d he retorted.\nBut she wouldn\u2019t tell him. When he sat next to her during the rest of the class and passed her\nlittle notes, she ignored them all. Later he thought that they might have developed a genuine impasse\nin their friendship had the odd attack on the newcomer not occurred during that very session.\nDoctor Nikidik had been lecturing on the Life Force. Entwining around each wrist the two\nseparate tendrils of his long straggly beard, he spoke in falling tones so that only the first half of each\nsentence made it to the back of the room. Hardly a single student was following. When Doctor\nNikidik took a small bottle from his vest pocket and mumbled something about \u201cExtract of\n\n\fBiological Intention,\u201d only the students in the front row sat up and opened their eyes. For Boq and\nElphaba, and everyone else, the patter ran-\u201cA little sauce for the soup mumble mumble, as if creation\nwere an unconcluded mumble mumble mumble, notwithstanding the obligations of all sentient\nmumble mumble mumble, and so as a little exercise to make those nodding off in the back of the\nmumble mumble mumble, behold a little mundane miracle, courtesy of mumble mumble mumble.\u201d\nA frisson of excitement had woken everyone up. The Doctor uncorked the smoky bottle and\nmade a jerky movement. They could all see a small puff of dust, like an effervescence of talcum\npowder, jostle itself in a swimming plume in the air above the neck of the bottle. The Doctor rowed\nhis hands a couple of times, to start the air currents eddying upward. Keeping some rare sort of\nspatial coherence, the plume began to migrate upward and over. The ooohs that the students were\ninclined to\nmake were all postponed. Doctor Nikidik held a finger out to them to shush them, and they\ncould tell why. A vast intake of breath would change the pattern of air currents and divert the floating\nmusk of powder. But the students began to smile, despite themselves. Above the stage, amid the\nstandard ceremonial stags\u2019 horns and brass trumpets on braid, hung four oil portraits of the founding\nfathers of Ozma Towers. In their ancient garb and serious expressions they looked down on today\u2019s\nstudents. If this \u201cbiological intention\u201d were to be applied to one of the founding fathers, what would\nhe say, seeing men and women students together in the great hail? What would he have to say about\nanything? It was a grand moment of anticipation.\nBut when a door to the side of the stage opened, the mechanics of the air currents were\ndisturbed. A student looked in, puzzled. A new student, oddly dressed in suede leggings and a white\ncotton shirt, with a pattern of blue diamonds tattooed on the dark skin of his face and hands. No one\nhad seen him before, or anyone like him. Boq clutched Elphaba\u2019s hand tightly and whispered, \u201cLook!\nA Winkle!\u201d\nAnd so it seemed, a student from the Vinkus, in strange ceremonial garb, coming late for class,\nopening the wrong door, confused and apologetic, but the door had shut behind him and locked from\nthis side, and there were no nearby seats available in the front rows. So he dropped where he was\nand sat with his back against the door, hoping, no doubt, to look inconspicuous.\n\u201cDrat and damn, the thing\u2019s been shabbed off course,\u201d said Doctor Nikidik. \u201cYou fool, why\ndon\u2019t you come to class on time?\u201d\nThe shining mist, about the size of a bouquet of flowers, had veered upward in a draft, and it\nbypassed the ranks of long-dead dignitaries waiting an unexpected chance to speak again. Instead it\ncloaked one of the racks of antlers, seeming for a few moments to hang itself on the twisting prongs.\n\u201cWell, I can scarcely hope to hear a word of wisdom from them, and I refuse to waste any more of\nthis precious commodity on classroom demonstrations,\u201d said Doctor Nikidik. \u201cThe research is still\nincomplete and I had thought that mumble mumble mumble. Let you discover for yourselves if\nmumble mumble mumble. I should hardly wish to prejudice your mumble.\u201d\nThe antlers suddenly took a convulsive twist on the wall, and wrenched themselves out of the\noaken paneling. They tumbled and shattered to the floor, to the shrieking and laughing of the students,\nespecially because for a minute Doctor Nikidik didn\u2019t know what the uproar was about. He turned\naround in time to see the antlers right themselves and wait, quivering, twitching, on the dais, like a\nfighting cock all nastied up and ready to go into the ring.\n\u201cOh well, don\u2019t look at me,\u201d said Doctor Nikidik, collecting his books, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for\nanything from you. Blame that one if you must.\u201d And he casually pointed at the Vinkus student, who\nwas cowering so wide-eyed that the more cynical of the older students began to suspect this was all\na setup.\nThe antlers stood on their points and skittered, crablike, across the stage. As the students rose in\n\n\fa common scream, the antlers scrabbled up the body of the Vinkus boy and pinned him against the\nlocked door. One wing of the rack caught him by the neck, shackling him in its V yoke, and the other\nreared back in the air to stab him in the face.\nDoctor Nikidik tried to move fast, and fell to his arthritic knees, but before he could right\nhimself two boys were up on the stage, out of the front row, grabbing the antlers and wrestling them\nto the ground. The Vinkus boy shrieked in a foreign tongue. \u201cThat\u2019s Crope and Tibbett!\u201d said Boq,\njouncing Elphaba in the shoulder, \u201clook!\u201d The sorcery students were all jumping on their seats and\ntrying to lob spells at the murderous antlers, and Crope and Tibbett found their grips and lost them\nand found them again, until at last they succeeded in breaking off one driving tine, then another, and\nthe pieces, still twitching, fell to the stage floor without further momentum.\n\u201cOh the poor guy,\u201d said Boq, for the Vinkus student had slumped down and was volubly\nweeping behind his blue-diamonded hands. \u201cI never saw a student from the Vinkus before. What an\nawful welcome to Shiz.\u201d\nThe attack on the Vinkus student provoked gossip and speculation. In sorcery the next day\nGlinda asked Miss Greyling to explain something. \u201cHow could Doctor Nikidik\u2019s Extract of\nBiological Intention or whatever it was, how could it fall under the heading of life sciences when it\nbehaved like a master spell? What really is the difference between science and sorcery?\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Miss Greyling, choosing this moment to apply herself to the care of her hair.\n\u201cScience, my dears, is the systematic dissection of\nnature, to reduce it to working parts that more or less obey universal laws. Sorcery moves in\nthe opposite direction. It doesn\u2019t rend, it repairs. It is synthesis rather than analysis. It builds anew\nrather than revealing the old. In the hands of someone truly skilled\u201d-at this she jabbed herself with a\nhair pin and yelped-\u201cit is Art. One might in fact call it the Superior, or the Finest, Art. It bypasses the\nFine Arts of painting and drama and recitation. It doesn\u2019t pose or represent the world. It becomes. A\nvery noble calling.\u201d She began to weep softly with the force of her own rhetoric. \u201cCan there be a\nhigher desire than to change the world? Not to draw Utopian blueprints, but really to order change?\nTo revise the misshapen, reshape the mistaken, to justify the margins of this ragged error of a\nuniverse? Through sorcery to survive?\u201d\nAt teatime, still awed and amused, Glinda reported Miss Greyling\u2019s little heartfelt speech to the\ntwo Thropp sisters. Nessarose said, \u201cOnly the Unnamed God creates, Glinda. If Miss Greyling\nconfuses sorcery with creation she is in grave danger of corrupting your morals.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Glinda, thinking of Ama Clutch on the bed of mental pain Glinda had once\nimagined for her, \u201cmy morals aren\u2019t in the greatest shape to start out with, Nessa.\u201d\n\u201cThen if sorcery is to be helpful at all, it must be in reconstructing your character,\u201d said\nNessarose firmly. \u201cIf you apply yourself in that direction, I suspect it will be all right in the end. Use\nyour talent at sorcery, don\u2019t be used by it.\u201d\nGlinda suspected that Nessarose might develop a knack for being witheringly superior. She\nwinced in advance, even while taking Nessarose\u2019s suggestion to heart.\nBut Elphaba said, \u201cGlinda, that was a good question. I wish Miss Greyling had answered it.\nThat little nightmare with the antlers looked more like magic than science to me, too. The poor\nVinkus fellow! Suppose we ask Doctor Nikidik next week?\u201d\n\u201cWho ever would have the courage to do that?\u201d cried Glinda. \u201cMiss Greyling is at least\nridiculous. Doctor Nikidik, with that lovable bumbling mumbling incoherent way he has-he\u2019s so\ndistinguished.\u201d\nAt the life sciences lecture the following week, all eyes were on the new Vinkus boy. He\narrived early and settled himself in the balcony, about as\nfar from the lectern as he could get. Boq had the suspicion of nomads all settled farmers\n\n\fpossessed. But Boq had to admit that the expression in the new boy\u2019s eyes was intelligent. Avaric,\nsliding into the seat next to Boq, said, \u201cHe\u2019s a prince, they say. A prince without a purse or a throne.\nA pauper noble. In his particular tribe, I mean. He stays at Ozma Towers and his name is Fiyero.\nHe\u2019s a real Winkle, full-blood. Wonder what he makes of civilization?\u201d\n\u201cIf that was civilization, last week, he must long for his own barbaric kind,\u201d said Elphaba from\nthe seat on the other side of Boq.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he wearing such silly paint for?\u201d said Avaric. \u201cHe only draws attention to himself.\nAnd that skin. I wouldn\u2019t want to have skin the color of shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a thing to say,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIf you ask me, that\u2019s a shitty opinion.\u201d\n\u201cOh please,\u201d said Boq. \u201cLet\u2019s just shut up.\u201d\n\u201cI forgot, Elphie, skin is your issue too,\u201d said Avaric.\n\u201cLeave me out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just had lunch, and you give me dyspepsia, Avaric. You\nand the beans we had at lunch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m changing my seat,\u201d warned Boq, but Doctor Nikidik came in just then, and the class rose to\nits feet in routine respect, then settled back noisily, chummily, chattering.\nFor a few minutes Elphaba waved her hand to get the Doctor\u2019s attention, but she was sitting too\nfar back and he was burbling on about something else. She finally leaned over to Boq and said, \u201cAt\nthe recess I\u2019ll change my seat and go forward so he can see me.\u201d Then the class watched as Doctor\nNikidik finished his inaudible preamble and beckoned a student to open the same door at the side of\nthe stage that Fiyero had stumbled through the previous week.\nIn came a boy from Three Queens rolling a table like a tea tray. On it, crouched as if to make\nitself as small as possible, was a lion cub. Even from the balcony they could sense the terror of the\nbeast. Its tail, a little whip the color of mashed peanuts, lashed back and forth, and its shoulders\nhunched. It had no mane to speak of yet, it was too tiny. But the tawny head twisted this way and that,\nas if counting the threats. It opened its mouth in a little terrified yawp, the infant form of an adult\nroar. All over the room hearts melted and people said \u201cAwwwwww.\u201d\n\u201cHardly more than a kitten,\u201d said Doctor Nikidik. \u201cI had thought to call it Prrr, but it shivers\nmore often than it purrs, so I call it Brrr instead.\u201d\nThe creature looked at Doctor Nikidik, and removed itself to the far edge of the trolley.\n\u201cNow the question of the morning is this,\u201d said Doctor Nikidik. \u201cPicking up from the somewhat\nskewed interests of Doctor Dillamond, who mumble mumble. Who can tell me if this is an Animal or\nan animal?\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t wait to be called on. She stood up in the balcony and launched her answer out in\na clear, strong voice. \u201cDoctor Nikidik, the question you asked was who can tell if this is an Animal\nor an animal. It seems to me the answer is that its mother can. Where is its mother?\u201d\nA buzz of amusement. \u201cCaught in the swamp of syntactical semantics, I see,\u201d said the Doctor\nmerrily. He spoke louder, as if having only now realized that there was a balcony in the hall. \u201cWell\ndone, Miss. Let me rephrase the question. Will someone here venture a hypothesis as to the nature of\nthis specimen? And give a reason for such an assessment? We see before us a beast at a tender age,\nlong before any such beast could command language if language were part of its makeup. Before\nlanguage-assuming language-is this still an Animal?\u201d\n\u201cI repeat my question, Doctor,\u201d sang out Elphaba. \u201cThis is a very young cub. Where is its\nmother? Why is it taken from its mother at such an early age? How even can it feed?\u201d\n\u201cThose are impertinent questions to the academic issue at hand,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cStill, the\nyouthful heart bleeds easily. The mother, shall we say, died in a sadly timed explosion. Let us\npresume for the sake of argument that there was no way of telling whether the mother was a Lioness\nor a lioness. After all, as you may have heard, some Animals are going back to the wild to escape the\n\n\fimplications of the current laws.\u201d\nElphaba sat down, nonplused. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to me,\u201d she said to Boq and Avaric. \u201cFor\nthe sake of a science lesson to drag a cub in here without its mother. Look how terrified it is. It is\nshivering. And it can\u2019t be cold.\u201d\nOther students began to venture opinions, but the Doctor shot them down one by one. The point\nbeing, apparently, that without language or contextual clues, at its infant stages a beast was not\nclearly Animal or animal.\n\u201cThis has a political implication,\u201d said Elphaba loudly. \u201cI thought this was life sciences, not\ncurrent events.\u201d\nBoq and Avaric shushed her. She was getting a terrible reputation as a loudmouth.\nThe Doctor dragged the episode out long after everyone had digested the point. But finally he\nturned and said, \u201cNow do you think that if we could cauterize that part of the brain that develops\nlanguage, we could eliminate the notion of pain and thus its existence? Early tests on this little torn\nlion show interesting results.\u201d He had picked up a small hammer with a rubber head, and a syringe.\nThe beast drew itself up and hissed, and then backed up and fell on the floor, and streaked toward\nthe door, which had closed and locked from this side as it had the previous week.\nBut it wasn\u2019t only Elphaba who was on her feet yelling. Half a dozen students were shouting at\nthe Doctor. \u201cPain? Eliminate pain? Look at the thing, it\u2019s terrified! It already gets pain! Don\u2019t do that,\nwhat are you, crazy?\u201d\nThe Doctor paused, visibly tightening his grip on the mallet. \u201cI will not preside over such\nshocking refusal to learn!\u201d he said, affronted. \u201cYou are leaping to harebrained conclusions based on\nsentiment and no observation. Bring the beast here. Bring it back. Young lady, I insist. I shall be\nquite cross.\u201d\nBut two girls from Briscoe Hall disobeyed and ran out of the room carrying the clawing lion\nclub in an apron between them. The room collapsed in an uproar and Doctor Nikidik stalked off the\nstage. Elphaba turned to Boq and said, \u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t get to ask Glinda\u2019s good question about\nthe difference between science and sorcery, do I? We were definitely headed down a different path\ntoday.\u201d But her voice was shaking.\n\u201cYou felt for that beast, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Boq was touched. \u201cElphie, you\u2019re trembling. I don\u2019t mean\nthis in an insulting way, but you\u2019ve nearly gone white with passion. Come on, let\u2019s sneak out and get\na tea at the cafe at Railway Square, for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d\nPerhaps every accidental cluster of people has a short period of grace, in between the initial\nshyness and prejudice on the one hand and eventual repugnance and betrayal on the other. For Boq it\nseemed that his summer obsession with the-then-Galinda made sense if only to usher in this\nfollowing, more mature comfort with a circle of friends who had\nbegun to feel inevitably and permanently connected.\nThe boys still weren\u2019t allowed access to Crage Hall, nor the girls to the boys\u2019 schools, but the\ncity centre area of Shiz became an extension of the parlors and lecture halls in which they were\nallowed to mingle. On a midweek afternoon, on a weekend morning, they would meet by the canal\nwith a bottle of wine, or in a cafe or student watering hole, or they would walk about and discuss the\nfine points of Shiz architecture, or they would laugh about the excesses of their teachers. Boq and\nAvaric, Elphaba and Nessarose (with Nanny), Glinda, and sometimes Pfannee and Shenshen and\nMilla, and sometimes Crope and Tibbett. And Crope brought Fiyero along and introduced him,\nwhich frosted Tibbett for a week or so until the evening that Fiyero said, in his shy formal way, \u201cOf\ncourse-I have been married for some time. We marry young in the Vinkus.\u201d The others were agog at\nthe notion, and felt juvenile.\nTo be sure, Elphaba and Avaric needled each other mercilessly. Nessarose tried everyone\u2019s\n\n\fpatience with her religious rantings. Crope\u2019s and Tibbett\u2019s stream of saucy remarks got them dumped\nin the canal more than once. But Boq was relieved to find that his crush on Glinda was lifting\nsomewhat. She sat on the edge of the picnic blanket with a look of self-reliance, and she diverted\nconversation away from herself. He had loved the girl who had loved the glamour in herself, and that\ngirl seemed to have disappeared. But he was happy to have Glinda as a friend. Well, in a nutshell:\nhe had loved Galinda and this now was Glinda. Someone he could no longer quite figure out. Case\nclosed.\nIt was a charmed circle.\nAll the girls steered clear of Madame Morrible while they could. One cold evening, however,\nGrommetik came hunting for the Thropp sisters. Nanny huffed and wound the strings of a fresh apron\naround her waist, and prodded Nessarose and Elphaba downstairs toward the parlor of the Head.\n\u201cI hate that Grommetik thing,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cHowever does it work, anyway? Is it\nclockwork or is it magicked, or some combination of the two?\u201d\n\u201cI always imagined a bit of nonsense-that there was a dwarf inside, or an acrobatic family of\nelves each working a limb,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cWhenever Grommetik comes around, my hand gets a strange hunger for a hammer.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Nessarose said. \u201cHand hunger, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cHush, you two, the thing has ears,\u201d Nanny said.\nMadame Morrible was glancing through the financial papers, making a few marks in the margin\nbefore she deigned to acknowledge her students. \u201cThis won\u2019t take but a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had\na letter from your dear father, and a package for you. I thought it kindest to deliver the news myself.\u201d\n\u201cNews?\u201d said Nessarose, blanching.\n\u201cHe could have written to us as well as to you,\u201d said Elphaba.\nMadame Morrible ignored her. \u201cHe writes to ask of Nessarose\u2019s health and progress, and to\ntell you both that he is going to undertake a fast and penance for the return of Ozma Tippetarius.\u201d\n\u201cOh, the blessed little girL\u201d said Nanny, warming to one of her favorite subjects. \u201cWhen the\nWizard took over the Palace all those years ago and he had the Ozma Regent jailed, we all thought\nthat the sainted Ozma child would call down disaster upon the Wizard\u2019s head. But they say she\u2019s\nbeen spirited away and frozen in a cave, like Lurlina. Has Frexspar got the mettle to melt her-is now\nher time to return?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Madame Morrible to the sisters, with a sour glance at Nanny, \u201cI haven\u2019t asked\nyou here so that your Nanny could discuss this contemporary apocrypha, nor to slander our glorious\nWizard. It was a peaceful transition of power. That the Ozma Regent\u2019s health failed while under\nhouse arrest was a mere coincidence, nothing more. As to the power of your father to raise the\nmissing royal child from some unsubstantiated state of somnolence-well, you\u2019ve as much as admitted\nto me that your father is erratic, if not mad. I can only wish him health in his endeavors. But I feel it\nmy duty to point out to you girls that we do not smile on seditious attitudes at Crage Hall. I hope you\nhave not imported your father\u2019s royalist yearnings into the dormitories here.\u201d\n\u201cWe assign ourselves to the Unnamed God, not to the Wizard nor to any possible remnant of the\nRoyal Family,\u201d Nessarose said proudly.\n\u201cI have no feeling on the matter at all,\u201d muttered Elphaba, \u201cexcept that Father loves lost\ncauses.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the Head. \u201cAs it should be. Now I have had a package for you.\u201d She handed\nit to Elphaba, but added, \u201cIt is for Nessarose, I think.\u201d\n\u201cOpen it, Elphie, please,\u201d said Nessarose. Nanny leaned forward to look.\nElphaba undid the cord and opened the wooden box. From a pile of ash shavings she withdrew\na shoe, and then another. Were they silver?-or blue?-or now red?-lacquered with a candy shell\n\n\fbrilliance of polish? It was hard to tell and it didn\u2019t matter; the effect was dazzling. Even Madame\nMorrible gasped at their splendor. The surface of the shoes seemed to pulse with hundreds of\nreflections and refractions. In the firelight, it was like looking at boiling corpuscles of blood under a\nmagnifying glass.\n\u201cHe writes that he bought them for you from some toothless tinker woman outside Ovvels,\u201d said\nMadame Morrible, \u201cand that he dressed them up with silver glass beads that he made himself-that\nsomeone had taught him to make?-\u201c\n\u201cTurtle Heart,\u201d said Nanny darkly.\n\u201c-and\u201d- Madame Morrible flipped the letter over, squinting-\u201che says he had hoped to give you\nsomething special before you left for university, but in the sudden circumstances of Ama Clutch\u2019s\nsickness . . . blah blah .. . he was unprepared. So now he sends them to his Nessarose to keep her\nbeautiful feet warm and dry and beautiful, and he sends them with his love.\u201d\nElphaba drove her fingers through the curlicues of shavings. There was nothing else in the box,\nnothing for her.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they gorgeous!\u201d Nessarose exclaimed. \u201cElphie, fix them on my feet, would you please?\nOh, how they sparkle!\u201d\nElphaba went on her knees before her sister. Nessarose sat as regal as any Ozma, spine erect\nand face glowing. Elphaba lifted her sister\u2019s feet and slipped off the common house slippers, and\nreplaced them with the dazzling shoes.\n\u201cHow thoughtful he is!\u201d said Nessarose.\n\u201cGood thing you can stand on your own two feet, you,\u201d muttered Nanny to Elphaba, and put her\nold hand patronizingly on Elphaba\u2019s shoulder blades, but Elphaba shrugged it away.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just gorgeous,\u201d said Elphaba thickly. \u201cNessarose, they\u2019re made for you. They fit like a\ndream.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Elphie, don\u2019t be cross,\u201d Nessarose said, looking down at her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin my small\nhappiness with resentment, will you? He knows you don\u2019t need this kind of thing. .\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t.\u201d\nThat evening the friends risked breaking curfew by ordering another bottle of wine. Nanny\ntutted and fretted, but as she kept downing her portion as neatly as anyone else, she was overruled.\nFiyero told the story of how he had been married at the age of seven to a girl from a neighboring\ntribe. They all gawped at his apparent lack of shame. He had only seen his bride once, by accident,\nwhen they were both about nine. \u201cI won\u2019t really take up with her until we are twenty, and I\u2019m now\nonly eighteen,\u201d he added. With the relief of imagining he might still be as virginal as the rest of them,\nthey ordered yet another bottle of wine.\nThe candles guttered, a small autumnal rain fell. Though the room was dry, Elphaba drew her\ncloak about her as if anticipating the walk home. She had gotten over the sting of being overlooked\nby Frex. She and Nessarose began to tell funny stories about their father, as if to prove to themselves\nand to everyone else that nothing was amiss. Nessarose, who wasn\u2019t much of a drinker, allowed\nherself to laugh. \u201cDespite my appearance, or maybe because of it, he always called me his beautiful\npet,\u201d she said, alluding to her lack of arms for the first time in public. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Come here,\nmy pet, and let me give you a piece of apple.\u2019 And I would walk over as best I could, tilting and\ntottering if Nanny or Elphie or Mother wasn\u2019t around to support me, and fall into his lap, and lean up\nsmiling, and he\u2019d drop small pieces of fruit into my mouth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he call you, Liphie?\u201d asked Glinda.\n\u201cHe called her Fabala,\u201d interrupted Nessarose.\n\u201cAt home, at home only,\u201d Elphaba said.\n\u201cTrue, you are your father\u2019s little Fabala,\u201d crooned Nanny, almost to herself, just outside the\n\n\fcircle of smiling faces. \u201cLittle Fabala, little Elphaba, little Elphie.\u201d\n\u201cHe never called me pet,\u201d said Elphaba, raising her glass to her sis\nter. \u201cBut we all know he told the truth, as Nessarose is the pet in the family. Hence those\nsplendid shoes.\u201d\nNessarose blushed and accepted a toast. \u201cAh, but while I had his attention because of my\ncondition, you captured his heart when you sang,\u201d she said.\n\u201cCaptured his heart? Hah. You mean I performed a necessary function.\u201d\nBut the others said to Elphaba, \u201cOh, do you sing? Well then! Sing, sing, you must! Another\nbottle, another glass, push back the chair, and before we leave for the night, you must sing! Go on!\u201d\n\u201cOnly if the others will,\u201d said Elphaba, bossily. \u201cBoq? Some Munchkinlander spinniel? Avaric,\na Gilhikinese ballad? Glinda? Nanny, a lullaby?\u201d\n\u201cWe know a dirty round, we\u2019ll go next if you go,\u201d said Crope and Tibbett.\n\u201cAnd I will sing a Vinkus hunting chant,\u201d said Fiyero. Everyone chortled with pleasure and\nclapped him on the back. So then Elphaba had to stand, push her chair aside, clear her throat and\nsound a note into her cupped hands, and start. As if she were singing for her father, again, after all\nthis time.\nThe bar mother slapped her rag at some noisy older men to shush them, and the dart players\ndropped their hands to their sides. The room quieted down. Elphaba made up a little song on the\nspot, a song of longing and otherness, of far aways and future days. Strangers closed their eyes to\nlisten.\nBoq did too. Elphaba had an okay voice. He saw the imaginary place she conjured up, a land\nwhere injustice and common cruelty and despotic rule and the beggaring fist of drought didn\u2019t work\ntogether to hold everyone by the neck. No, he wasn\u2019t giving her credit: fliphaba had a good voice. It\nwas controlled and feeling and not histrionic. He listened through to the end, and the song faded into\nthe hush of a respectful pub. Later, he thought: The melody faded like a rainbow after a storm, or like\nwinds calming down at last; and what was left was calm, and possibility, and relief.\n\u201cYou next, you promised,\u201d cried Elphaba, pointing at Fiyero, but nobody would sing again,\nbecause she had done so well. Nessarose nodded to Nanny to wipe a tear from the corner of her eye.\n\u201cElphaba says she\u2019s not religious but see how feelingly she sings of the afterlife,\u201d said\nNessarose, and for once no one was inclined to argue.\nEarly one morning, when the world was hoary with rimefrost, Grommetik arrived with a note\nfor Glinda. Ama Clutch, it seemed, was on her way out. Glinda and her roommates hurried to the\ninfirmary.\nThe Head met them there, and led them to a windowless alcove. Ama Clutch was thrashing\nabout in the bed and talking to the pillowcase. \u201cDon\u2019t put up with me,\u201d she was saying wildly, \u201cfor\nwhat will I ever do for you? I will abuse your good nature, duckie, and rest my oily locks upon your\nfine close weave and I will be picking with my teeth at your lacy appliqued edge! You are a stupid\nnuisance to allow it, I say! I don\u2019t care about notions of service! It\u2019s all bunk, I tell you, bunk!\u201d\n\u201cAma Clutch, Ama Clutch, it\u2019s me,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cListen, dear, it\u2019s me! It\u2019s your little\nGalinda.\u201d\nAma Clutch turned her head from side to side. \u201cYour protest is insulting to your forebears!\u201d she\nwent on, rolling her eyes toward the pillowcase again. \u201cThose cotton plants on the banks of\nRestwater didn\u2019t allow themselves to be harvested so you could lie down like a mat and let any\nfilthy person slobber all over you with night drool! It don\u2019t make a lick of sense!\u201d\n\u201cAma!\u201d Glinda wept. \u201cPlease! You\u2019re raving!\u201d\n\u201cAha, I see you have nothing to say to that,\u201d said Ama Clutch with satisfaction.\n\u201cCome back, Ama, come back, one more time before you go!\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh sweet Lurline, this is dreadful,\u201d Nanny said. \u201cDarlings, if I ever get like this, poison me,\nwill you?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s going, I can see it,\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cI saw it enough in Quadling Country, I know the\nsigns. Glinda, say what you need to say, quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMadame Morrible, may I have privacy?\u201d Glinda said.\n\u201cI will stay by your side and support you. It\u2019s my duty to my girls,\u201d said the Head, settling her\nhamlike hands determinedly on her waist. But Elphaba and Nanny got up and elbowed her out of the\nalcove, down the\nhall, and through the door and closed it and locked it. Nanny clucked all the while, saying,\n\u201cNow, isn\u2019t that nice of you, Madame Head, but no need. No need at all.\u201d\nGlinda gripped Ama Clutch\u2019s hand. Beads of white sweat were forming like potato water on\nthe servant\u2019s forehead. She struggled to pull her hand away but her strength was going. \u201cAma Clutch,\nyou\u2019re dying,\u201d Glinda said, \u201cand it\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\u201cOh stop,\u201d Elphaba said.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Glinda said fiercely, \u201cit is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not arguing that,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cI just mean cut yourself out of the conversation; this is her\ndeath, not your interview with the Unnamed God. Come on. Do something!\u201d\nGlinda grabbed the hands, both hands, even tighter. \u201cI am going to magick you back,\u201d she said\nbetween gritted teeth. \u201cAma Clutch, you do as I say! I\u2019m still your employer and your better, and you\nhave to obey me! Now listen to this spell and behave yourself!\u201d\nThe Ama\u2019s teeth gnashed, the eyes rolled, and the chin twisted knobbily, as if trying to impale\nsome invisible demon in the air above her bed. Glinda\u2019s eyes shut and her jaw worked, and a thread\nof sound, syllables incoherent even to herself, came spooling out from her blanched lips. \u201cHope you\ndon\u2019t explode her like a sandwich,\u201d muttered Elphaba.\nGlinda ignored this. She hummed and worked, she rocked and panted. Ama Clutch\u2019s eyelids\nmoved so frantically over the closed eyes that it looked as if her eye sockets were chewing her own\neyes. \u201cMagicordium senssus ovinda clenx,\u201d Glinda concluded out loud, \u201cand if that doesn\u2019t do it, I\ngive up; even the smells and bells of a full kit wouldn\u2019t help, I think.\u201d\nOn the straw pallet Ama Clutch fell back. A little blood ran from the outer edge of each eye.\nBut the wild turning motion of the focus had shuttered itself down. \u201cOh my dear,\u201d she murmured, \u201cso\nyou\u2019re all right then, or am I dead now?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cYes, dear Ama, yes, I\u2019m fine. But sweetheart, I think you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am, the Wind is here, can\u2019t you hear it?\u201d Ama Clutch said. \u201cNo matter. Oh there\u2019s\nElphie, too. Good-bye, my ducks. Stay out of the Wind until the time is right or you\u2019ll be blown in\nthe wrong direction.\u201d\nGlinda said, \u201cAma Clutch, I have something to say to you-I have to make my apology-\u201c\nBut Elphaba leaned forward, cutting Glinda off from Ama Clutch\u2019s line of sight, and said, \u201cAma\nClutch, before you go, tell us who killed Doctor Dillamond.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you know that,\u201d Ama Clutch said.\n\u201cMake us sure,\u201d Elphaba said.\n\u201cWell, I saw it, I mean nearly. It had just happened and the knife was still there\u201d-Ama Clutch\nworked for breath-\u201csmeared with blood that hadn\u2019t had a chance to dry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you see? This is important.\u201d\n\u201cI saw the knife in the air, I saw the Wind come to take Doctor Dillamond away, I saw the\nclockwork turn and the Goat\u2019s time stop.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Grommetik, wasn\u2019t it,\u201d Elphaba murmured, trying to get the old woman to speak the\nwords.\n\n\f\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, duckie,\u201d said Ama Clutch.\n\u201cAnd did it see you, did it turn on you?\u201d cried Glinda. \u201cDid that make you ill, Ama Clutch?\u201d\n\u201cIt was my time to be ill,\u201d said Ama Clutch gently, \u201cso I couldn\u2019t complain. And it is my time to\ndie, so leave me be. Just hold my hand, dear.\u201d\n\u201cBut the fault is mine-\u201d began Glinda.\n\u201cYou would do me more good if you hushed, sweet Galinda, my duck,\u201d said Ama Clutch gently,\nand patted Glinda\u2019s hand. Then she closed her eyes and breathed in and out a couple of times. They\nsat there in a silence that seemed peculiarly servant-class-Gillikinese, though it was hard, later on, to\nexplain why. Outside, Madame Morrible moved up and down the floorboards, pacing. Then they\nimagined they heard a Wind, or an echo of a Wind, and Ama Clutch was gone, and the overly\nsubordinate pillowcase took a small spill of human juice from the edge of her slackened mouth.\nThe funeral was modest, a love-her-and-shove-her affair. Glinda\u2019s close friends attended,\nfilling two pews, and in the second tier of the\nchapel a flock of Amas made a professional coterie. The rest of the chapel was empty.\nAfter the corpse in its winding sheet slid along the oiled chute to the furnace, the mourners and\ncolleagues retired to Madame Morrible\u2019s private parlor, where she proved to have sanctioned no\nexpense in the refreshments. The tea was ancient stock, stale as sawdust, the biscuits were hard, and\nthere was no saffron cream or tamorna marmalade. Glinda said reprovingly to the Head, \u201cNot even a\nsmall bowl of cream?\u201d and Madame Morrible answered, \u201cMy girl, I try to protect my charges from\nthe worst of the food shortages by judicious shopping and by going without myself, but I am not\nwholly responsible for your ignorance. If only people would obey the Wizard absolutely, there\nwould be abundance. Don\u2019t you realize that conditions verge on famine and cows are dying of\nstarvation two hundred miles from here? This makes saffron cream very dear in the market.\u201d Glinda\nbegan to move away, but Madame Morrible reached out a raft of cushiony, bulbous, bejeweled\nfingers. The touch made Glinda\u2019s blood run cold. \u201cI should like to see you, and Miss Nessarose, and\nMiss Elphaba,\u201d said the Head. \u201cAfter the guests leave. Please wait behind.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re nabbed for a lecture,\u201d whispered Glinda to the Thropp sisters. \u201cWe have to be yelled\nat.\u201d\n\u201cNot a word about what Ama Clutch said-or that she came back,\u201d said Elphaba urgently. \u201cGot\nthat, Nessa? Nanny?\u201d\nThey all nodded. Boq and Avaric, making their good-byes, said that the group was reconvening\nat the pub in the Regent\u2019s Parade. The girls agreed to meet them there after their interview with the\nHead. They would manage a more honest memorial service for Ama Clutch at the Peach and\nKidneys.\nWhen the small crowd had dispersed, only Grommetik clearing away the cups and crumbs,\nMadame Morrible herself banked up the fire-a gesture of chumminess lost on no one-and sent\nGrommetik away. \u201cLater, thingy,\u201d she said, \u201clater. Go lubricate yourself in some closet somewhere.\u201d\nGrommetik wheeled away with, if it was possible, an offended air. Elphaba had to repress an urge to\nkick it with the tip of her stout black walking boot.\n\u201cYou too, Nanny,\u201d Madame Morrible said. \u201cA little break from your labors.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Nanny said. \u201cNanny doesn\u2019t leave her Nessa.\u201d\n\u201cYes Nanny does. Her sister is perfectly capable of caring for her,\u201d said the Head. \u201cAren\u2019t you,\nMiss Elphaba? The very soul of charity.\u201d\nElphaba opened her mouth-the word soul always provoked her, Glinda knew-but closed it\nagain. She made a wincing nod toward the door. Without a word, Nanny got up to leave, but before\nthe door closed behind her Nanny said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to complain, but really: no cream? At a\nfuneral?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cHelp,\u201d said Madame Morrible when the door closed, but Glinda wasn\u2019t sure if this was a\ncriticism of servants or a bid for sympathy. The Head rallied herself by arranging her skirts and the\nvents and braids of her smart parlor jacket. In orangey copper sequins she looked like a huge,\nupholstered, upended goldfish goddess. How ever did she get to be Head? Glinda wondered.\n\u201cNow that Ama Clutch has gone to ash, we shall, nay, we must move bravely on,\u201d Madame\nMomble began. \u201cMy girls, may I first ask you to recount the sad story of her last words. It is\nessential therapy in your recovery from grief.\u201d\nThe girls didn\u2019t look at one another. Glinda, in this situation the spokesperson, took a breath\nand said, \u201cOh, she spewed nonsense to the last.\u201d\n\u201cNo surprise, the dotty old thing,\u201d said Madame Morrible, \u201cbut what nonsense?\u201d\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it out,\u201d said Glinda.\n\u201cI had wondered if she talked about the death of the Goat.\u201d\nGlinda said, \u201cOh the Goat? Well I could hardly tell-\u201c\n\u201cI suspected that, in her deranged condition, she might return to that critical moment. The dying\noften try to make sense, at the last possible moment, of the puzzles of their lives. Useless effort, of\ncourse. No doubt Ama Clutch was puzzled by what she came across, the Goat\u2019s body, the blood.\nAnd Grommetik.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Glinda faintly. The sisters beside her were careful not to stir.\n\u201cThat terrible morning I was up early-at my spiritual meditations-and I noticed the light in\nDoctor Dillamond\u2019s lab. So I sent Grommetik over with a cheering pot of tea for the old Goat.\nGrommetik\nfound the Animal slumped over a broken lens; he\u2019d apparently stumbled and severed his own\njugular vein. Such a sad accident, born of academic zeal (not to say hubris) and a pitiful lack of\ncommon sense. Rest, we all need rest, the brightest of us need our rest. Grommetik in its confusion\nfelt for a pulse-none to be found-and I surmise that is just when Ama Clutch arrived. To see dear\nGrommetik splashed with the spurts of a strong circulatory pulse. Ama Clutch arrived out of\nnowhere and none of her business, I might add, but let\u2019s not malign the dead, shall we?\u201d\nGlinda gulped back new tears, and did not mention that Ama Clutch had mentioned seeing\nsomething unusual the evening before, and had wandered out to check.\n\u201cI did always think that the shock of all that blood might have been the final straw that sent Ama\nClutch pitching back into her ailment. Incidentally, you see why I dismissed Grommetik just now. It\u2019s\nstill very sensitive and suspects, I believe, that Ama Clutch thought it responsible for the Goat\u2019s\nslaughter.\u201d\nGlinda said waveringly, \u201cMadame Morrible, you should know that Ama Clutch had never\nsuffered such a disease as I described to you. I invented it. But I didn\u2019t assign it. I didn\u2019t commit it to\nher, or her to it.\u201d\nElphaba looked at Madame Morrible steadily, keeping her interest modest. Nessarose\u2019s\neyelashes fluttered. If Madame Morrible knew Glinda\u2019s news already, her face didn\u2019t give her away.\nShe looked as placid as a tethered rowboat. \u201cWell, this only lends weight to my observations,\u201d she\nallowed. \u201cThere is an imaginative, even a prophetic power in your pointed little society skull, Miss\nGlinda.\u201d\nThe Head stood, her skirts rustling, wind through a field of wheat. \u201cWhat I say now I say in\nstrictest confidence. I expect my girls to obey my command. Are we agreed?\u201d She seemed to take\ntheir stunned silence as assent. She looked down on them. That\u2019s why she seems so like a fish,\nGlinda suddenly thought. She hardly ever blinks.\n\u201cBy an authority vested in me that is too high to be named, I have been charged with a crucial\ntask,\u201d said the Head. \u201cA task essential to the internal security of Oz. I have been working to fulfill\n\n\fthis task for some years, and the time is right, and the goods are at my disposal.\u201d She scrutinized\nthem. They were the goods.\n\u201cYou will not repeat what you hear in this room,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\nwill not want to, you will not choose to, and you will not be able to. I am wrapping each one of\nyou in a binding cocoon as regards this very sensitive material. No\u201d-she held up a hand at Elphaba\u2019s\nprotest-\u201cno you have no right to object. The deed is already done and you must listen and be open to\nwhat I say.\u201d\nGlinda tried to examine herself to see if she felt wrapped, or bound, or spell-chilled. But she\nonly felt frightened and young, which may be close to the same thing. She glanced at the sisters.\nNessarose in her dazzling shoes was back in her chair, nostrils dilating in fright or excitement.\nElphaba on the other hand looked as stolid and cross as usual.\n\u201cYou live in a little womb here, a tight little nest, girl with girl. Oh I know you have your silly\nboys on the edge, forgettable things. Good for one thing only and not even reliable at that. But I\ndigress. I must say that you know little or nothing of the state of the nation today. You have no sense\nof the pitch of unrest to which things have mounted. Setting communities on edge, ethnic groups\nagainst one another, bankers against farmers and factories against shopkeepers. Oz is a seething\nvolcano threatening to erupt and burn us in its own poisonous pus.\n\u201cOur Wizard seems strong enough. Ah, hut is he? Is he really? He has a grasp of internal\npolitics. He\u2019s no slouch at negotiating rates of exchange with the bloodsuckers of Ev or Jemmicoe or\nFliaan. He rules the Emerald City with an industry and an ability that the decaying knob-jawed Ozma\nline never dreamed of. Without him we\u2019d have been swept away in firestorm, years ago. We can but\nbe grateful. A strong fist does wonders in a rotten situation. Walk softly but carry a bit stick. I see I\noffend. Well, a man is always good for the public face of power, no?\n\u201cYes. But things are not always as they seem. And it has been clear for some time that the\nWizard\u2019s bag of tricks would not do forever. There are bound to be popular uprisings-the stupid,\nsenseless kind, in which strong dumb people enjoy getting killed for the sake of political changes\nthat\u2019ll be rolled back within the decade. Adds such meaning to meaningless lives, don\u2019t you think?\nOne can\u2019t imagine any other reason for it. At any rate, the Wizard needs some agents. He requires a\nfew generals. In the long run. Some people with managing skills. Some people with gumption.\n\u201cIn a word, women.\n\u201cI have called you three girls in here. You are not women yet, but\nthe moment is closing in on you, faster than you might think. Despite my opinion as to your\nbehavior, I have had to single you out. There is more in each one of you than meets the eye. Miss\nNessarose, being the newest, you are the most hidden to me, but once you outgrow that fetching habit\nof faith you will display a ferocious authority. Your bodily disorder is of no significance here. Miss\nElphaba, you are an isolate, and even in my binding spell you sit there stewing in scorn of every\nword I say. This is evidence of great internal power and force of will, something I deeply respect\neven when marshaled against me. You have shown no sign of interest in sorcery and I don\u2019t claim\nyou have any natural aptitude. But your splendid lone-wolf spit and spirit can be harnessed, oh yes it\ncan, and you needn\u2019t live a life of unfulfilled rage. And Miss Glinda: You have surprised yourself\nwith the talents at sorcery you possess. I knew you would. I had hoped your inclinations might rub\noff on Miss Elphaba, but that they haven\u2019t is only firmer proof of Miss Elphaba\u2019s iron character.\n\u201cI see in your eyes you all question my methods. You think, somewhat wildly: Did Horrible\nMorrible cause that nail to pierce my Ama Clutch\u2019s foot, making me have to room with Elphaba?\nDid she cause Ama Clutch to come downstairs and find the dead Goat, the better to get her out of the\nway and require Nanny and thus Nessarose to show up on the scene? How flattering that you even\nimagine I have such power.\u201d\n\n\fThe Head paused and came near to blushing, which in her was something like the separating of\ncream on a flame set too high. \u201cI am a handmaiden at the service of superiors,\u201d she continued, \u201cand\nmy special talent is to encourage talent. In my own small way I have been called to a vocation of\neducation, and here I make my little contributions to history.\n\u201cNow to be specific. I want you to consider your futures. I would like to name you, to baptize\nyou as it were, as a trio of Adepts. In the long run I would like to assign you behind-the-scenes\nministerial duties in different parts of the country. I am empowered to do this, remember, by those\nwhose boot straps I am not worthy to lick.\u201d But she looked smug, as if she thought herself quite\nworthy enough, indeed, of attention from these mysterious forces. \u201cLet us say you will be secret\npartners of the highest level of government. You will be anonymous ambassadors of peace, helping\nto restrain the unruly element among our less civilized populations. Nothing is decided yet, of\ncourse, and you do have a say in the matter-a\nsay to me, and not to each other nor anyone else, as the spell goes-but I would like you to think\nabout it. I need-eventually-to place an Adept in Gillikin somewhere. Miss Glinda, with your middlerange social position and your transparent ambitions, you can slime your way into ballrooms of\nmargreaves and still be at home in the pigsties. Oh, don\u2019t squirm so, your good blood is only on one\nside and it\u2019s not a terribly refined strain anyway. The Adept of Gillikin, Miss Glinda? Does it\nappeal?\u201d\nGlinda could only listen. \u201cMiss Elphaba,\u201d said Madame Morrible, \u201cfull of the teenage scorn of\ninherited position, you are nonetheless the Thropp Third Descending, and your great-grandfather, the\nEminent Thropp, is in his dotage. One day you will inherit what is left of Colwen Grounds, that\npretentious pile in Nest Hardings, and you could manage to be the Adept of Munchkinland. Your\nunfortunate skin condition notwithstanding-indeed, perhaps because of it-you have developed a\nfeistiness and an iconoclasm that is just faintly appealing when it doesn\u2019t nauseate. It will come in\nservice. Believe me.\n\u201cAnd Miss Nessarose,\u201d she went on, \u201chaving grown up in Quadling Country, you will want to\nreturn there with Nanny. The social situation in Quadling Country is such a mess, what with the\ndecimation of the squelchy froglet population, but it may come back, in small measure, and there\nshould be someone to oversee the ruby mines. We need someone to look after things in the South.\nOnce you recover from your religious mania, it\u2019ll be a perfect setting. You don\u2019t expect a life of high\nsociety anyway, not without arms. After all, how can one dance without arms?\n\u201cAs for the Vinkus, we don\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll need an Adept stationed there, at least not in your\nlifetimes. The master plans eradicate any appreciable population in that godforsaken place.\u201d\nHere the Head paused and looked around. \u201cOh, girls. I know you are young. I know this grieves\nyou. You mustn\u2019t think of it as a prison sentence, though, but an opportunity. You ask yourselves:\nHow will I grow in a position, albeit a silent one, of prominence and responsibility? How may my\ntalents flourish? How, my dears, how may I help my Oz?\u201d\nElphaba\u2019s foot twisted, caught the edge of a side table, and a cup and saucer fell to the floor\nand smashed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so predictable,\u201d said Madame Morrible, sighing. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes my job so easy.\nNow girls, bound as you are to an oath of silence, I\nbid you to go away and think on what I have said. Please don\u2019t even try to discuss it together as\nit\u2019ll just give you a headache and cramps. You won\u2019t be able to manage it. Sometime in the next\nsemester I will call each of you in here and you can give me your answer. And if you should choose\nnot to help your country in its hour of need She clasped her hands in a parody of despair. \u201cWell, you\nare not the only fish in the sea, are you?\u201d\nThe afternoon had turned glowery, with heaps of plum-colored clouds in the north, beyond the\n\n\fbluestone spires and steeples. The temperature had dropped twenty degrees since the morning, and\nthe girls kept their shawls pulled close as they walked to the pub. Nanny, shivering in the dirty wind,\ncried, \u201cAnd what did the old busybody have to say that I couldn\u2019t be allowed to hear?\u201d\nBut there was nothing they could say. Glinda couldn\u2019t even meet the others\u2019 eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll lift a\nglass of champagne for Ama Clutch,\u201d said Elphaba finally, \u201cwhen we get to the Peach and Kidneys.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d settle for a spoonfui of real cream,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cHow pinching that old sow is. No\nrespect for the dead.\u201d\nBut Glinda found that the binding spell was deeper, cut closer than she had even understood. It\nwasn\u2019t merely that they couldn\u2019t talk about it. Already she had begun-to lose the words about it, to\nfalter in her thinking, to fail to commit the interview to memory. There was the proposal. It was a\nproposal, wasn\u2019t it? Of some questionable proposition in (was it) the civil service? Doing somesome ballroom dancing, which didn\u2019t make sense. Some laughing, a glass of champagne, a handsome\nman taking off his cummerbund and pressing his starched cuffs against her neck, nibbling the\nteardrop-shaped rubies at her ears . . . Talk softly but carry a bit stick. Or was it not a proposal but a\nprophecy? A little friendly encouragement about the future? And she had been alone, the others\nhadn\u2019t been listening. Madame Morrible had spoken directly to her. A lovely testimony to Glinda\u2019s .\n. . potential. The chance to rise. Walk softly but marry a big prick. A man draping his evening tie on\na bedstead and rolling his diamond studs, nudging them with his nose, down the declivity of her\nsuperior neck . . . It was a dream, Madame Morrible couldn\u2019t have said that! She must be dazed with\ngrief. Poor Ama Clutch. It had only been a quiet word of condolence from the dear and\nself-effacing Head, who found it hard to speak in public. But a man\u2019s tongue between her legs, a\nspoonful of saffron cream\u2026\nNessarose said, \u201cCatch her, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m-\u201d and she sagged against Nanny\u2019s bosom, and Glinda\nswooned at the same moment. Elphaba thrust out strong arms and scooped Glinda in mid-collapse.\nGlinda didn\u2019t really lose consciousness, but the uncomfortable physical nearness of hawk-faced\nElphaba after that undesired act of desire made her want to shiver with revulsion and to purr at the\nsame time. \u201cSteady on, girl, not here,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cresist, come on!\u201d Resist was just what Glinda\ndidn\u2019t want to do. But after all, in the shadow of an apple cart, on the edge of the market where\nmerchants were selling the last fish of the day, cheap, well, this was hardly the place. \u201cTough, tough\nskin,\u201d said Elphaba, appearing to pull words from the back of her throat. \u201cCome on, Glinda-you\u2019ve\ngot better brains-come on! I love you too much, snap out of it, you idiot!\u201d\n\u201cWell, really,\u201d she said as Elphaba dumped her on a heap of moldy packing straw. \u201cNo need to\nbe so romantic about it!\u201d But she felt better, as if a wave of illness had just passed.\n\u201cYou girls, I tell you, the faints, it comes from those tight shoes,\u201d said Nanny, huffing and\nloosening Nessarose\u2019s glamorous footwear. \u201cSensible folk wear leather or wood.\u201d She massaged\nNessarose\u2019s insteps for a minute, and Nessarose moaned and arched her back, but began in a few\nmoments to breathe more normally.\n\u201cWelcome back to Oz,\u201d said Nanny after a while. \u201cWhat goodies were you all snacking on, in\nthere with the Head?\u201d\n\u201cCome on, they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cNo sense dawdling. Anyway, I\u2019m afraid it might\nrain.\u201d\nAt the Peach and Kidneys, the rest of the gang had commandeered a table in an alcove several\nsteps above the main floor. They were well into their cups by that point in the afternoon, and it was\nclear tears had been shed. Avaric sat slouched against the brick wall of the student den, one arm\nslung around Fiyero and his legs stretched out in Shenshen\u2019s lap. Boq and Crope were arguing about\nsomething, anything, and Tibbett was singing an interminable song to Pfannee, who looked as if she\nwanted to drive a dart into the thick of his thigh. \u201cAhh, the ladies,\u201d slurred Avaric, and made as if to\n\n\frise.\nThey sang, and chattered, and ordered sandwiches, and Avaric\nplunked down an embarrassment of coins to demand a salver of saffron cream, in Ama Clutch\u2019s\nmemory. Money did wonders and the cream was found in the larder, which gave Glinda an uneasy\nfeeling, though she didn\u2019t know why. They spooned the airy mounds into one another\u2019s mouths,\nsculpted with it, mixed it in their champagne, threw it in small gobbets at one another until the\nmanager came over and told them to get the hell out. They complied, grumbling. They didn\u2019t know it\nwas the last time they would all be together, or they might have lingered.\nA brisk rain had come and gone, but the streets were still noisy with runoff, and the lamplight\nglistened and danced in the silvery black curvetts of water caught among the cobbles. Imagining the\npossible brigand in the shadows, or the hungry wanderer lurking nearby, they stood close together.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d said Avaric, putting one foot this way and the other that, as if he were as flexible\nas a man of straw. \u201cWho\u2019s man enough for the Philosophy Club tonight?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d said Nanny, who hadn\u2019t had that much to drink.\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d whined Nessarose, swaying more than usual.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what it is,\u201d said Boq, giggling and hiccuping.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t want to leave tonight,\u201d Nessarose said. \u201cWe only have one another and I\ndon\u2019t want to be left out, and I don\u2019t want to go home!\u201d\n\u201cHush Nessa, hush hush, my pretty,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThat\u2019s not the place for you, or me either.\nCome on, we\u2019re going home. Glinda, come on.\u201d\n\u201cI have no Ama now,\u201d said wide-eyed Glinda, stabbing a finger toward Elphaba. \u201cI am my own\nagent. I want to go to the Philosophy Club and see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cThe rest can do what they want but we\u2019re going home,\u201d said Elphaba.\nGlinda veered over toward Elphaba, who was homing in on a very uncertain-looking Boq.\n\u201cNow Boq, you don\u2019t want to go to that disgusting place, do you?\u201d Elphaba was saying. \u201cCome on,\ndon\u2019t let the boys make you do something you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d he said, appearing to address the hitching post. \u201cElphie, how do you\nknow what I want? Unless I find out? Hmmm?\u201d\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d said Fiyero to Elphaba. \u201cPlease, if we ask you politely?\u201d\n\u201cI want to go too,\u201d whined Glinda.\n\u201cOh, come, Glinny-dinny,\u201d said Boq, \u201cmaybe they\u2019ll pick us. For old times\u2019 sake, as never\nwas.\u201d\nThe others had awakened a slumbering cab driver and hired his services. \u201cBoq, Glinda, Elphie,\ncome on,\u201d Avaric called from the window. \u201cWhere\u2019s your nerve?\u201d\n\u201cBoq, think about this,\u201d Elphaba urged.\n\u201cI always think, I never feel, I never live,\u201d he moaned. \u201cCan\u2019t I live once in a while? Just once?\nJust because I\u2019m short I\u2019m not an infant, Elphie!\u201d\n\u201cNot till now,\u201d said Elphaba. Rather smarmy tonight, thought Glinda, and wrenched herself\naway to climb into the cab. But Elphaba grabbed her by the elbow and pivoted her around. \u201cYou\ncan\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Emerald City.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the Philosophy Club with my friends-\u201c\n\u201cTonight,\u201d hissed Elphaba. \u201cYou little idiot, we have no time to waste on sex!\u201d\nNanny had led Nessarose away already, and the cabbie clucked his reins and the equipage\nlumbered away. Glinda stumbled and said, \u201cWhat did you think you were just about to say? To say?\u201d\n\u201cI already said it and I\u2019m not saying it again,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cMy dear, you and I are going back\nto Crage Hall tonight only to pack a valise. Then we\u2019re away.\u201d\n\u201cBut the gates\u2019ll be locked-\u201c\n\n\f\u201cIt\u2019s over the garden wall,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cand we\u2019re going to see the Wizard, come what may\nand hell to pay.\u201d\nBoq could not believe he was heading to the Philosophy Club at last. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t\nvomit at a crucial moment. He hoped he would remember the whole thing tomorrow, or at least some\nkernel of it, despite the headache forming vengefully in the hollows at his temples.\nThe place was discreet, though it was the best known dive in Shiz. It hid behind a facade of\npaneled-up windows. A couple of Apes roamed the street in front, bouncing troublemakers ahead of\ntime. Avaric counted\nthe party carefully as they fell from the cab. \u201cShenshen, Crope, me, Boq, Tibbett, Fiyero, and\nPfannee. Seven. Boy how\u2019d we all fit in the cab, could hardly fit us I\u2019d think.\u201d He paid the cabbie\nand tipped him, in some obscure homage still to Ama Clutch, and then pushed to the front of the silent\nknot of companions. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re the right age and the right drunk,\u201d he said, and to the\nshadowed face at the window, \u201cSeven. Seven of us, good sir.\u201d\nThe face came forward to the glass and leered at him. \u201cThe name is Yackle, and I\u2019m not a sir\nnor am I good. What kind are you up to tonight, Master Fellow?\u201d Speaking through the pane was a\ncrone, with random teeth and a shiny white-pink wig slipping westwards off her pearly scalp.\n\u201cKind?\u201d said Avaric, then more bravely, \u201cAny kind.\u201d\n\u201cI mean the tickets, sweetbread. Strutting and strumming on the sprung floor, or strumpeting in\nthe old wine cellars?\u201d\n\u201cThe works,\u201d said Avaric.\n\u201cYou understand house rules? The locked doors, the if-you-pay-you-play policy?\u201d\n\u201cGive us seven, and hurry up about it. We\u2019re not fools.\u201d\n\u201cYou never are fools,\u201d said the beastly woman. \u201cWell, here you are then, and come what may.\nOr who may.\u201d She affected a stance of virtue, like a painting of a unionist virgin saint. \u201cEnter and be\nsaved.\u201d\nThe door swung open, and they went down a flight of uneven brick steps. At the bottom of the\nflight was a dwarf in a purple burnoose. He looked at their tickets, and said, \u201cWhere are you soft\nthings from? Out of town?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all at the university,\u201d said Avaric.\n\u201cA motley crew. Well, you\u2019ve seven-of-diamond tickets. See here, the seven red diamonds\nprinted here, and here.\u201d He said, \u201cHave a drink on the house, watch the girlie show, and dance a\nlittle if you want. Every hour or so I close this street door and open the next.\u201d He pointed to a huge\noak door, barred with two monstrous timbers in iron hasps. \u201cYou all go in together or you don\u2019t go\nin at all. That\u2019s the rule of the house.\u201d\nThere was a chanteuse singing a send-up of \u201cWhat Is Oz Without Ozma,\u201d and teasing herself\nwith a parrot-colored feather boa. A small hand of elves-real elves!-tootled and rattled out a tinny\naccompani\nment. Boq had never seen an elf, even though he knew there was a colony of them not far from\nRush Margins. \u201cHow weird,\u201d he said, inching forward. They looked like hairless monkeys, naked\nbut for little red caps, and without any appreciable sex characteristics. They were as green as sin.\nBoq turned to say, Look, Elphie, it\u2019s like you had a passel of babies, but he didn\u2019t see her and\nremembered then that she hadn\u2019t come. Nor had Glinda, apparently. Damn.\nThey danced. The crowd was the most mixed Boq had seen in some time. There were Animals,\nhumans, dwarfs, elves, and several tiktok things of incomplete or experimental gender. A squadron\nof well-built blond boys circulated with tumblers of rotgut squash wine, which the friends drank\nbecause it was free.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go any more daring than this,\u201d said Pfannee to Boq at one point. \u201cI\n\n\fmean, look, that hussy of a Baboon is almost out of her dress. Perhaps we should call it a night.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think?\u201d said Boq. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m game, but if you\u2019re feeling uneasy.\u201d Oh hurrah, a way\nout. He was feeling uneasy himself. \u201cWell let\u2019s get Avaric. He\u2019s over there nosing up to Shenshen.\u201d\nBut before they could make their way across the crowded dance floor, the elves began to let out\na banshee screech, and the singer thrust out her hip and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the mating call, dollies! Ladies\nand gentle-friends! We\u2019re doing, and I do mean doing\u201d-she glanced at a note in her hand-\u201cfive black\nclubs, three black clubs, six red hearts, seven red diamonds, and-on their honeymoon, isn\u2019t it sweet\u201dshe simulated gagging-\u201ctwo black spades. Up to the mouth of everlasting bliss, fraidies and\ngentlehens.\u201d\n\u201cAvaric, no,\u201d said Boq.\nBut the crone from the front, who called herself Yackle, came knocking through the hall-having\napparently locked up the front door for the time being-and she remembered the holders of the\ndesignated cards, and brought them forward with a smile. \u201cAll rides, all riders, on the ready,\u201d she\nsaid, \u201chere we be, at the shank end of the evening! Lighten up, lads, it\u2019s not a funeral, it\u2019s an\nentertainment!\u201d It had been a funeral, Boq remembered, trying to invoke the warm, self-effacing\nspirit of Ama Clutch. But the time to back out, if such a time existed, had passed.\nThey were swept through the oak doors and along a slightly sloping\npassage whose walls were padded in red and blue velvet. A merry tune was playing farther on,\na dancing ragged melody. A smell of roasting timm leaves-sweet and softening, you could almost\nfeel them turning up their purplish edges. Yackle led the way, and the twenty-three revelers\nprocessed, in a confused state of apprehension, elation, and randiness. The dwarf followed behind.\nBoq took stock, as best his stumbling mind could manage. An erect Tiger in hip boots and a cape. A\ncouple of bankers and their evening consorts, all wearing black masques: as a protection against\nblackmail or as an aphrodisiac? A party of merchants from Ev and Fliaan, in town on business. A\ncouple of women rather long in the tooth, bedecked in costume jewelry. The honeymoon couple were\nGlikkuns. Boq hoped that his crowd wasn\u2019t gawping as much as the Glikkuns were. As he glanced\naround, only Avaric and Shenshen looked eager-and Fiyero, possibly because he hadn\u2019t yet grasped\nwhat this was all about. The others looked more than a little squeamish.\nThey entered a small dark theatre-in-the-round, with the space for the public divided into six\nstalls. Above, the ceiling was lost in a stony blackness. Tapers fluttered, and a hollow music issued\nthrough fissures in the wall, increasing an unearthly air of dislocation and otherness. The stalls\ncircled and faced the central stage, which was enshrouded in black drapes. The stalls were\nseparated from one another by vertical strips of latticed wood and slats of mirror. All the parties\nwere being mixed up, all friends and partners separated. Was there incense in the air too? It seemed\nto make Boq\u2019s mind split in half, like a husk, and allow a tenderer, complacent mind to emerge. The\nsofter, more bruisable aspect, the private intention, the surrendering self.\nHe felt he was knowing less and less, and it was more and more beautiful to do so. Why had he\nbeen alarmed? He was sitting on a stool, and around him in the stall sat, almost preternaturally near,\na man in a black masque, an Asp he hadn\u2019t noticed before, the Tiger whose breath ran hot and meaty\non his neck, a beautiful schoolgirl, or was that the bride on her honeymoon? Did the whole stall then\ntilt forward, like a gently swung bucket? Anyway, they leaned together toward the central dais, an\naltar of veils and sacrifices. Boq loosened his collar and then his belt, felt the gingery appetite\nbetween heart and stomach and the resulting stiffening apparatus below that. The music of pipes and\nwhistles was\nslowing, or was it that as he watched and waited and breathed so, so slowly, that the secret\narea inside himself uncloaked itself, where nothing mattered?\nThe dwarf, in a darker hood now, appeared on the stage. He could see from his vantage point\n\n\finto all the stalls but the revelers in separate stalls couldn\u2019t see one another. The dwarf leaned and\nreached a hand here, there, welcoming, beckoning. He encouraged from one stall the figure of a\nwoman, from another a man (was it Tibbett?), and from the stall where Boq sat he gestured to the\nTiger. Boq felt only faintly sony not to be chosen himself as he watched the dwarf pass a smoking\nvial beneath the nostrils of the three acolytes, and help them to remove their clothes. There were\nshackles, and a tray of scented oils and emollients, and a chest whose contents were still in shadow.\nThe dwarf bound black blindfolds around the heads of the scholars.\nThe Tiger was pacing on all fours and growling softly, tossing his head back and forth in\ndistress or excitement. Tibbett-for it was he, though nearly out of consciousness-was made to lie on\nhis back on the floor of the stage. The Tiger strode over him and stood still while the dwarf and his\nassistants lifted Tibbett and tied his wrists together, around the Tiger\u2019s chest, and his ankles around\nthe Tiger\u2019s pelvis, soTibbett hung beneath the Tiger\u2019s belly, like a trussed pig, his face lost in the\nTiger\u2019s chest hair.\nThe woman was set on a sloping stool, almost like a huge tilting bowl, and the dwarf tucked\nsomething aromatic and runny up in the shadowy regions. Then the dwarf pointed to Tibbett, who\nwas beginning to twist and moan into the Tiger\u2019s chest. \u201cLet X be the Unknown God,\u201d said the\ndwarf, poking Tibbett in the ribs. The dwarf then slapped the Tiger on his flank with a riding crop,\nand the Tiger strained forward, positioning his head between the woman\u2019s legs. \u201cLet Y be the\nDragon of Time in its cave,\u201d said the dwarf, hitting the Tiger again.\nAs he laced the woman into the half-shell, stroking her nipples with a glowing salve, he handed\nher a riding crop with which she could lash at the Tiger\u2019s flanks and face. \u201cAnd let Z be the Kumbric\nWitch, and let us see if she exists tonight The crowd drew nearer, almost participants themselves,\nand the musky sense of adventure made them tear at their own buttons and nibble their own lips,\nleaning in, in, in.\n\u201cSuch are the variables in our equation,\u201d said the dwarf as the room\ndarkened even further. \u201cSo now, let the true, clandestine study of knowledge begin.\u201d\nThe industrialists of Shiz, from an early stage wary of the growing power of the Wizard, had\nelected not to lay down the rail line from Shiz to the Emerald City as originally planned. Therefore,\nit was a good three days\u2019 journey from Shiz to the Emerald City-and this was in the best of weather,\nfor the wealthy who could pay for a constant change of horses. For Glinda and Elphaba it took more\nthan a week. A bleak, cold-scoured week, as the winds of autumn ripped the leaves off trees with a\ndry screech and a rattle of brittle, protesting limbs.\nThey rested, like other third-class travelers, in the back rooms above inn kitchens. In a single\nlumpy bed, they huddled together for warmth and encouragement and, Glinda told herself, protection.\nThe others cooed and shrieked in the stableyard below, the kitchen maids came and went noisily, at\nodd hours. Glinda would start as if from a frightful dream, and nestle in nearer to Elphaba, who\nseemed at night never to sleep. Daytimes, the long hours spent in poorly sprung carriages, Elphaba\nwould nod off against Glinda\u2019s shoulder. The land outside grew less succulent and varied. Trees\nwere crabbed, as if conserving their strength.\nAnd then the sandy scrubland was domesticated by farm life. Overgrazed fields were dotted\nwith cows, their withers shriveled and papery, their lowing desperate. An emptiness settled in the\nfarmyards. Once Glinda saw a farm woman standing on her doorstep, hands sunk deep in apron\npockets, face lined with grief and rage at the useless sky. The woman watched the carriage pass, and\nher face showed a yearning to be on it, to be dead, to be anywhere else other than on this carcass of a\nproperty.\nThe farms gave way to deserted mills and abandoned granges. Then, abrupt and decisive, the\nEmerald City rose before them. A city of insistence, of blanket declaration. It made no sense, clotting\n\n\fup the horizon, sprouting like a mirage on the characterless plains of central Oz. Glinda hated it from\nthe moment she saw it. Brash upstart of a city. She\nsupposed it was her Gillikinese superiority asserting itself. She was glad of it.\nThe carriage passed through one of the northern gates, and the scramble of life aroused itself\nagain, but in an urban key, less restrained and self-forgiving than that of Shiz. The Emerald City was\nnot amused by itself, nor did it consider amusement a proper attitude for a city. Its high self-regard\nsprang up in public spaces, ceremonial squares, parks and facades and reflecting pools. \u201cHow\njuvenile, how devoid of irony,\u201d murmured Glinda. \u201cThe pomp, the pretension!\u201d\nBut Elphaba, who had passed through the Emerald City only once before, on her way up to Shiz,\nhad no interest in architecture. She had her eyes glued on the people. \u201cNo Animals,\u201d she said, \u201cnot\nso you can see, anyway. Maybe they have all gone underground.\u201d\n\u201cUnderground?\u201d said Glinda, thinking of legendary menaces like the Nome King and his\nsubterranean colony, or dwarves in their mines in Glikkus, or the Time Dragon of the old myths,\ndreaming the world of Oz from his airless tomb.\n\u201cIn hiding,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cLook, the poor-I mean are they the poor? The hungry of Oz? From\nthe failed farms? Or is it just the-the surplus? The expendable human selvage? Look at them, Glinda,\nthis is a real question. The Quadlings, having nothing, looked-more-than these-\u201c\nOff the boulevard on which they rode branched alleys, where shelves of tin and cardboard\nserved as roofs for the flood of indigents. Many of them were children, though some were the\ndiminutive Munchkinlanders, and some were dwarves, and some were Gillikinese bowed with\nhunger and strain. The carriage moved slowly, and faces stood out. A Glikkun youth with no teeth\nand no feet or calves, on his stumpy knees in a box, begging. A Quadling-\u201cLook, a Quadling!\u201d said\nElphaba, grabbing Glinda\u2019s wrist. Glinda caught a glimpse of a ruddy brown woman in a shawl,\nlifting a small apple to the child in a sling around her neck. Three Gihikinese girls dressed like\nwomen for hire. More children in a pack, running and squealing like piglets, pressing up against a\nmerchant, to pick his pockets. Rag merchants with pushcarts. Kiosk keepers whose goods lay locked\nbeneath safety grilles. And a sort of civil army, if you could call it that, strolling in foursomes on\nevery second or third street, brandishing clubs, angular with swords.\nThey paid the carriage master and walked with their parcels of clothes toward the Palace. It\nrose, in stepped-back fashion, a growth of domes and minarets, high flared buttresses in green\nmarble, blue agate screens in the recessed windows. Central and most prominent, the broad, gentlebrowed canopies of the pagoda lifted over the Throne Room, covered with hammered scales of\nvirgin gold, brilliant in the late afternoon gloom.\nFive days later they had made it past the gatekeeper, the receptionists, and the social secretary.\nThey had sat for hours awaiting a three-minute interview with the Commander-General of\nAudiences. Elphaba, a hard, twisted look on her face, had managed to eject the words \u201cMadame\nMorrible\u201d from between her clamping lips. \u201cTomorrow at eleven,\u201d said the Commander-General.\n\u201cYou will have four minutes between the Ambassador to Ix and the Matron of the Ladies\u2019 Home\nGuard Social Nourishment Brigade. Dress code is formal.\u201d He handed them a card of regulations\nthat, being unequipped with courtly dress, they were obliged to ignore.\nAt three the following afternoon (everything running late), the Ambassador to Ix left the Throne\nRoom looking agitated and splenetic. Glinda fluffed the bedraggled feathers in her traveling hat for\nthe eightieth time, and sighed, \u201cNow you\u2019re the one who says what should be said.\u201d Elphaba nodded.\nTo Glinda she looked tired, terrified, but strong, as if her form were knit with iron and whiskey\ninstead of bones and blood. The Commander-General of Audiences appeared in the doorway of the\nwaiting salon.\n\u201cYou have four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not approach until you are bade to do so. Do not speak\n\n\funtil you are addressed. Do not venture a remark unless it is to answer a comment or question. You\nmay refer to the Wizard as \u2018Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds pretty regal to me. I thought that royalty had been-\u201d But here Glinda elbowed\nElphaba to make her shut up. Really, Elphaba had no common sense sometimes. They hadn\u2019t come so\nfar just to be turned away because of adolescent radicalism.\nThe Commander-General took no notice. As they approached a set of tall double doors, carved\nwith sigils and other occult hieroglyphs, the Commander-General mentioned, \u201cThe Wizard is not in a\ngood humor today due to the reports of a riot in the Ugabu district in the north of\nWinkle Country. I should be prepared for what I find, were I you.\u201d Two stoical doormen\nopened the doors then, and they passed through.\nBut the throne did not lie before them. Instead, the antechamber led left, and through an archway\nthere was another, but on a shifting axis to the right, and another beyond that, and another. It was like\nlooking through a reflection of a corridor in mirrors set opposite each other; it veered inward. Or,\nthought Glinda, like processing through the narrowing, deviating chambers of a nautilus. They made a\ncircuit through eight or ten salons, each slightly smaller than the other, each steeped in a curdled light\nthat fell from leaded panes above. At last the antechambers concluded at an archway into a\ncavernous circular hall, higher than it was wide, and dark as a chapel. Antique wrought-iron stands\nheld ziggurats of molded beeswax burning with a multitude of wicks, and the air was close and\nslightly floury. The Wizard was absent, though they saw the throne on a circular dais, inset emeralds\ngleaming dully in the candlelight.\n\u201cHe stepped out to use the toilet,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll wait.\u201d\nThey stood at the archway, not daring to venture farther without invitation.\n\u201cIf we only have four minutes, I hope this doesn\u2019t count,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI mean, it took us two\nminutes just to get from there to here.\u201d\n\u201cAt this point-\u201d said Elphaba, and then, \u201cShhhhh.\u201d\nGlinda shhhhhhed. She didn\u2019t think she heard anything, then she wasn\u2019t sure. There was no\nchange that she could identify in the gloom, but Elphaba looked like a pointer on alert. Her chin was\nout, her nose high and nostrils flared, her dark eyes squinting and widening.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe sound of-\u201c\nGlinda heard no sounds, unless it was the hot air lifting from the flames into the chilly shadows\nbetween dark rafters. Or was it the rustle of silk robes? Was the Wizard approaching? She looked\nthis way and that. No-there was a rustle, a sort of hiss, as of bacon rashers in a skillet. The candle\nflames suddenly all genuflected, obeisant to a sour wind that beat from the area of the throne.\nThen the dais was pelted with thick drops of rain, and a shudder of homegrown thunder blatted\nout, more dropped kitchen kettles than timpani. On the throne was a skeleton of dancing lights; at first\nGlinda\nthought lightning, but then she realized it was luminescent bones hitched together to suggest\nsomething vaguely human, or at least mammalian. The rib cage flexed open like two fretted hands,\nand a voice spoke in the storm, not from the skull but from the dark eye of the storm where the heart\nof the lightning creature should be, in the tabernacle of the rib cage.\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\u201d it said, and shook the room with its related weather. \u201cWho\nare you?\u201d\nGlinda glanced at Elphaba. \u201cGo on, Elphie,\u201d she said, nudging her. But Elphaba looked\nterrified. Well, of course, the rain. She had that thing about rainstorms.\n\u201cWhooo arrrre youuuu?\u201d bellowed the thing, the Wizard of 0z, whatever.\n\u201cElphie,\u201d hissed Glinda. Then, \u201cOh, you useless thing, all talk and no-I\u2019m Glinda from Frottica,\n\n\fif you please, Your Highness, descended matrilineally from the Arduennas of the Upland, and this if\nyou please is Elphaba, the Thropp Third Descending from Nest Hardings. If you please.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t please?\u201d said the Wizard.\n\u201cOh really, how like a child,\u201d said Glinda under her breath. \u201cElphie, come on, I can\u2019t say why\nwe\u2019re here!\u201d\nBut the banal comment of the Wizard\u2019s seemed to snap Elphaba out of her terror. Staying where\nshe was at the edge of the room, gripping Glinda\u2019s hand for support, Elphaba said, \u201cWe\u2019re students\nof Madame Morrible at Crage Hall in Shiz, Your Highness, and we\u2019re in possession of some vital\ninformation.\u201d\n\u201cWe are?\u201d said Glinda. \u201cThanks for telling me.\u201d\nThe small rain seemed to let up a bit, though the room stayed dark as an eclipse. \u201cMadame\nMorrible, that paragon of paradoxes,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cVital information of her, I wonder?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThat is, it is not for us to interpret what we hear. Gossip is unreliable.\nBut-\u201c\n\u201cGossip is instructive,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cIt tells which way the wind is blowing.\u201d The wind\nthen blew in the direction of the girls, and Elphaba danced back to avoid being spattered. \u201cGo ahead,\ngirls, gossip.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWe\u2019re here on more important business.\u201d\n\u201cElphie!\u201d said Glinda. \u201cDo you want to get us thrown in prison?\u201d\n\u201cWho are you to decide what is important business?\u201d roared the Wizard.\n\u201cI keep my eyes open,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call us here to ask for our gossip; we came\nwith our own agenda.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know I didn\u2019t call you here?\u201d\nWell, they didn\u2019t know, especially after whatever it was had happened to them at tea with\nMadame Morrible. \u201cScale down, Elphie,\u201d whispered Glinda, \u201cyou\u2019re making him mad.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cI\u2019m mad.\u201d She spoke up again. \u201cI have news of the murder of a great\nscientist and a great thinker, Your Highness. I have news of important discoveries that he was\nmaking, and their suppression. I have every interest in the pursuit of justice and I know you do too,\nso that the amazing revelations of Doctor Dillamond will help you to reverse your recent judgments\non the rights of Animals-\u201c\n\u201cDoctor Dillamond?\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cIs that all this is about?\u201d\n\u201cIt is about an entire population of Animals systematically deprived of their-\u201c\n\u201cI know of Doctor Dillamond and I know of his work,\u201d said the glowing bones of the Wizard,\nsnorting. \u201cDerivative, unauthenticated, specious garbage. What you\u2019d expect of an academic Animal.\nPredicated on shaky political notions. Empiricism, quackery, tomfoolery. Cant, rant, and rhetoric.\nWere you taken in perhaps by his enthusiasm? His Animal passion?\u201d The skeleton danced a jig, or\nperhaps it was a twitch of disgust. \u201cI know of his interests and his findings. I know little of what you\ncall his murder and I care less.\u201d\n\u201cI am not a slave to emotions,\u201d Elphaba said sternly. She was pulling papers from her sleeve,\nwhere she had apparently rolled them up around her arm. \u201cThis is not propaganda, Your Highness.\nThis is a well-argued Theory of Consciousness Inclination, is what he calls it. And you will be\namazed to learn of his discoveries! No right-thinking ruler can afford to ignore the implica-\u201c\n\u201cThat you presume me to be right-thinking is touching,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cYou may drop the\nthings where you stand. Unless you prefer to approach?\u201d The lightning-marionette grinned and\nstretched out its arms. \u201cMy pet?\u201d\nElphaba dropped the papers. \u201cGood, my Lord,\u201d she said in a piercing, pretentious voice, \u201cI\nshall take you to be right-thinking, for did I not, I should be obliged to join an army against you.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cOh hell, Elphie,\u201d said Glinda, then more loudly, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t speak for the both of us, Your\nHighness, I\u2019m an independent person here.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Elphaba, at once hard and soft, proud and pleading. Glinda realized she had\nnever before witnessed Elphaba wanting anything. \u201cPlease, sir. The hardship on the Animals is more\nthan can be borne. It isn\u2019t just the murder of Doctor Dillamond. It\u2019s this forced repatriation, this-this\nchattelizirig of free Beasts. You must get out and see the sorrow. There is talk of-there is worry that\nthe next step will be slaughter and cannibalism. This isn\u2019t merely youthful outrage. Please, sir. This\nis not untrammeled emotion. What\u2019s happening is immoral-\u201c\n\u201cI do not listen when anyone uses the word immoral,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cIn the young it is\nridiculous, in the old it is sententious and reactionary and an early warning sign of apoplexy. In the\nmiddle-aged, who love and fear the idea of moral life the most, it is hypocritical.\u201d\n\u201cIf not immoral, then what word can I use to imply wrong?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cTry mysterious and then relax a little. The thing is, my green girlie, it is not for a girl, or a\nstudent, or a citizen to assess what is wrong. This is the job of leaders, and why we exist.\u201d\n\u201cBut then nothing would keep me from assassinating you, did I not know what wrong was.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in assassination, I don\u2019t even know what it means,\u201d Glinda called. \u201cYoo boo.\nI\u2019m going to take my leave now while I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cI have something to ask you.\u201d\nThey stood still. They stood for minutes. The skeleton fingered its ribs, played them like the\nbrittle strings of a harp. Music like stones turning over in a streambed. The skeleton collected its\nlighted teeth from its jaws and juggled them. Then it tossed them at the seat of the throne, where they\nexploded in candy-colored flashes. The rain was running down a drain in the floor, Glinda noticed.\n\u201cMadame Morrible,\u201d said the Wizard. \u201cAgent provocateur and gossip, crony and companion,\nteacher and minister. Tell me why she sent you here.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cDo you even know the meaning of the word pawn?\u201d shrieked the Wizard.\n\u201cDo you know what resistance means?\u201d Elphaba shot back.\nBut the Wizard only laughed instead of killing them on the spot. \u201cWhat does she want of you?\u201d\nGlinda spoke up; it was about time. \u201cA decent education. For all her bombastic ways she\u2019s a\ncapable administrator. It can\u2019t be easy.\u201d Elphaba was staring at her with a queer, slanted look.\n\u201cHas she brought you in-?\u201d\nGlinda didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cWe\u2019re only sophisters. We have only begun to specialize. I in\nsorcery, Elphaba in life sciences.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d The Wizard seemed to consider. \u201cAnd after you graduate next year?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll go back to Frottica and get married.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t answer.\nThe Wizard turned itself around, broke off its femurs, and pounded the seat of the throne as if it\nwere a kettledrum. \u201cReally, this is getting ridiculous, it\u2019s all pleasure faith showbiz,\u201d said Elphaba.\nShe took a step or two forward. \u201cExcuse me, Your Highness? Before our time is up?\u201d\nThe Wizard turned back. Its skull was on fire, a fire not quenched by the thickening curtain of\nrain. \u201cI shall say one last thing,\u201d the Wizard ventured, in a voice like a groan, a voice of one in pain.\n\u201cI shall quote from the Oziad, the hero tale of ancient Oz.\u201d\nThe girls waited.\nThe Wizard of Oz recited:\n\u201cThen hobbling like a glacier, old Kumbricia\nRubs the naked sky till it rains with blood.\n\n\fShe tears the skin off the sun and eats it hot.\nShe tucks the sickle moon in her patient purse.\nShe bears it out, a full-grown changeling stone.\nShard by shard she rearranges the world.\nIt looks the same, she says, but it is not.\nIt looks as they expect, but it is not.\n\u201cBeware whom you serve,\u201d said the Wizard of Oz. Then he was gone, and the gutters in the\nfloor gurgled, and the candles went instantly out. There was nothing for them to do but retrace their\nsteps.\nAt the carriage, Glinda had settled in and made a little nest for them in the desirable forwardfacing seat, guarding Elphaba\u2019s place against three other passengers. \u201cMy sister,\u201d she lied, \u201cI am\nsaving this seat for my sister.\u201d And how I have changed, she thought, in a year and some. From\ndespising the colored girl to claiming we are blood! So university life does change you in ways you\ncannot guess. I may be the only person in all the Pertha Hills ever to meet our Wizard. Not on my\nown steam, not of my initiative-still, I was there. I did it. And we\u2019re not dead.\nBut we didn\u2019t accomplish much.\nThen, there was Elphie, at last, barreling along the paving stones with her elbows jutting and\nher thin bony torso swathed against the elements, as usual, in a cape. She came up through the crowd,\nbatting at more refined passengers to get past, and Glinda shoved open the door. \u201cThank heavens, I\nthought you\u2019d be late,\u201d she said. \u201cThe driver is eager to leave. Did you get a lunch for us?\u201d\nElphaba tossed in her lap a couple of oranges, a hunk of unrepentant cheese, and a loaf of bread\nthat filled the compartment with pungent staleness. \u201cThis\u2019ll have to do you till your stop this\nevening,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMe, me?\u201d said Glinda. \u201cWhat do you mean, me? Have you got something better to eat for\nyourself?\u201d\n\u201cSomething worse, I expect,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cbut needs to be done. I\u2019ve come to say good-bye.\nI\u2019m not going back with you to Crage Hall. I\u2019ll find a place to study on my own. I\u2019ll not be part ofMadame Morrible\u2019s-school-again-\u201c\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Glinda, \u201cI can\u2019t let you! Nanny will eat me alive! Nessarose will die! Madame\nMorrible will-Elphie, no. No!\u201d\n\u201cTell them I kidnapped you and made you come here, they\u2019ll believe that of me,\u201d said Elphaba.\nShe stood on the mounting tread. A fat Glikkun female dwarf, having caught the gist of the drama,\nshifted to the more comfortable seat next to Glinda. \u201cThey needn\u2019t look for me, Glinda, for I\u2019m not\ngoing to be findable. I\u2019m going down.\u201d\n\u201cDown where? Back to Quadling Country?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be telling,\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t lie to you, my dear. No need to lie. I don\u2019t\nknow yet where I\u2019m going. I haven\u2019t decided so I wouldn\u2019t have to lie.\u201d\n\u201cElphie, get in this cab, don\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Glinda cried. The driver was adjusting the reins and\nyelling at Elphaba to sod off.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Elphaba said, \u201cnow you\u2019re a seasoned traveler. This is just the return leg\nof a voyage you already know.\u201d She put her face against Glinda\u2019s and kissed her. \u201cHold out, if you\ncan,\u201d she murmured, and kissed her again. \u201cHold out, my sweet.\u201d\nThe driver clucked the reins, and pitched a cry to leave. GlInda craned her head to see Elphaba\ndrift back into the crowds. For all her singularity of complexion, it was astounding how quickly she\nbecame camouflaged in the ragamuffin variety of street life in the Emerald City. Or maybe it was\nfoolish tears blurring Glinda\u2019s vision. Elphaba hadn\u2019t cried, of course. Her head had turned away\nquickly as she stepped down, not to hide her tears but to soften the fact of their absence. But the\n\n\fsting, to Glinda, was real.\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\n\n\fBook 3 - City of Emeralds\nOn a clammy late summer evening about three years after graduating from Shiz University,\nFiyero stopped at the unionist chapel in Saint Glinda\u2019s Square, to pass some time before meeting a\nfellow countryman at the opera.\nFiyero hadn\u2019t taken to unionism as a student, but he had developed an eye for frescoes that often\nadorned the cubbyholes of older chapels. He was hoping to find a portrait of Saint Glinda. He had\nnot seen Glinda of the Arduennas of the Uplands since her graduation-she had finished a year before\nhe did. But he hoped it wouldn\u2019t be sacrilegious to light a charmwax candle in front of Saint\nGlinda\u2019s likeness, and to think of her namesake.\nA service was ending, and the congregation of sensitive adolescent boys and black-scarved\ngrandmothers drifted slowly out. Fiyero waited until the lyre player in the nave had finished\nfingering a tricky diminuet, then he approached her. \u201cDo forgive me-I\u2019m a visitor from the west.\u201d\nWell obviously, with his rich ochre skin color and tribal markings. \u201cI don\u2019t see a sexton-a verger-a\nsacristan, whatever the word is-nor can I find a pamphlet to tell me-I was looking to find an ikon of\nSaint Glinda?\u201d\nHer face remained grave. \u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if it hasn\u2019t been papered over with a poster of Our\nGlorious Wizard. I\u2019m an itinerant musician, only through this way once in a while. But I think you\nmight look in the last aisle; there\u2019s an oratory to Saint Glinda, or used to be. Good luck.\u201d\nLocating it-a tomblike space with an archer\u2019s slit instead of a true window-Fiyero saw, lit by a\npinkish sanctuary light, a smoky image of the Saint, leaning a bit to the right. The portrait was merely\nsentimental and not robustly primitive, a disappointment. Water damage had made great white stains\nlike laundry soap mistakes on the Saint\u2019s holy garments. He couldn\u2019t remember her particular legend,\nnor the uplifting way that she had gagged on death for the sake of her soul and for the edifica tion of\nher admirers.\nBut then he saw, in the underwatery shadows, that the oratory was inhabited by a penitent. The\nhead was bowed in prayer, and he was about to move away when it struck him that he knew who it\nwas.\n\u201cElphaba!\u201d he said.\nShe turned her head slowly; a lace shawl dropped to her shoulders. Her hair was looped on her\nhead and skewered with ivory hair\ncorkscrews. Her eyes batted once or twice slowly, as if she were moving toward him from a\ngreat distance away. He had interrupted her at prayer-he hadn\u2019t remembered her to be religiousmaybe she didn\u2019t recognize him.\n\u201cElphaba, it\u2019s Fiyero,\u201d he said, moving into the doorway, blocking her exit, and also the lightsuddenly he couldn\u2019t see her face, and wondered if he heard correctly when she said, \u201cI beg your\npardon, sir?\u201d\n\u201cElphie-I\u2019m Fiyero-we were at Shiz,\u201d he said. \u201cMy splendid Elphie-how are you?\u201d\n\u201cSir, I believe you are mistaking me for someone else,\u201d she said, in Elphaba\u2019s voice.\n\u201cElphaba, the Thropp Third Descending, if I remember the nomenclature,\u201d he said, laughing\nstoutly, \u201cI\u2019m not mistaken at all. I\u2019m Fiyero of the Arjikis-you know me, you remember me! From\nDoctor Nikidik\u2019s lectures in the life sciences!\u201d\n\u201cYou have confused yourself,\u201d she said, \u201csir.\u201d That last word sounded a bit shirty, absolutely\nElphaba. \u201cNow you don\u2019t mind if I am about my devotions in peace?\u201d She drew her shawl up above\nher head, and arranged it to fall about her temples. The chin in profile could slice a salami, and even\nin the low light he knew he wasn\u2019t wrong.\n\n\f\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he said. \u201cElphie-well, Miss Elphaba, if you require-don\u2019t shab me off like this. Of\ncourse it\u2019s you. There\u2019s no disguising you. \u2018What game are you about?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t answer him in words, but by telling her beads ostentatiously she was telling him to\nget lost.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting my meditation, sir,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDo I have to call the verger and have\nyou removed?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you outside,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long do you need to pray? Half an hour? An hour? I\u2019ll\nwait.\u201d\n\u201cIn an hour, then, across the street; there\u2019s a small public fountain with some benches. I\u2019ll talk\nwith you for five minutes, five minutes only, and show you that you\u2019ve made a mistake. Not a serious\none, but increasingly annoying to me.\u201d\n\u201cForgive the intrusion. In an hour then-Flphaba.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to let her get away with\nwhatever game she was playing. He withdrew, however, and went to the musician at the back of the nave. \u201cIs there another exit to this\nbuilding besides the main doors?\u201d he asked, over her spurts of arpeggio. VVhen it was convenient to\nanswer him, she tucked her head and moved her eyes. \u201cSide door through to the cloister of the\nmaunts, it\u2019s not open to the public, but you can get out to a servants\u2019 delivery alley through there.\u201d\nHe lingered in the shadow of a pillar. In about forty minutes, a cloaked figure entered the chapel\nand moved, hobbling with a cane, directly to the oratory Elphie occupied. He was too far away to\nhear if words were exchanged, or anything else. (Perhaps the newcomer was merely another disciple\nof Saint GlInda, and wanted solitude to pray.) The figure didn\u2019t linger; it left again as quickly as its\nstiffjoints would allow.\nFiyero dropped an offering in the poor box-a note, so to avoid the clink of coin. In a quarter of\nthe city so infested with the urban poor, his situation of comparative wealth required the penitential\ngift, though his motivation was characterized more by guilt than charity. Then he slipped out through\nthe side door, into an overgrown cloister garden. Some ancient women in wheeled chairs were\nchortling at the far end and didn\u2019t notice him. He wondered if Elphaba belonged to this community of\nmonastic nuns-maunts, they were called. He now remembered that they were females living in that\nmost paradoxical of institutions: a community of hermits. Apparently, however, their vows of silence\nwere revoked in the decay of old age. He decided that Elphaba couldn\u2019t have changed that much in\nfive years. So he let himself out the servants\u2019 entrance, into an alleyway.\nThree minutes passed, and Elphaba emerged from the same servants\u2019 entrance, as he had\nsuspected she would. She was intent on avoiding him! Why, why? The last he had seen of her-he\nremembered it wdll!-was the day of Ama Clutch\u2019s funeral, and the drunken party at the pub. She had\nfled to the Emerald City on some obscure mission, never to return, while he had been dragged off to\nthe eye-opening joys and terrors of the Philosophy Club. Rumor held that the great-grandfather, the\nEminent Thropp, had engaged agents to look for her in Shiz, in the Emerald City. From Elphaba\nherself there was never a postcard, never a message, never a clue. Nessarose had been inconsolable\nat first, and then grew to resent her sister\u2019s putting her through this pain of separation. Nessa had lost\nherself deeper in religion, to the point where her friends had begun to avoid her.\nTomorrow Fiyero would make his apologies for missing the opera and standing up his business\ncolleague. Tonight he would not lose Elphaba. As she hurried through the streets, checking over her\nshoulder more than once, he thought: If you were trying to lose someone, if you did think someone\nwas on your trail, this is the time of day to do it-not because of shadows, but because of light.\nElphaba kept turning corners into the summer sun that, setting, was bowling blinding shafts of light\nalong side streets, through arcades, over the walls of gardens.\n\n\fBut he had had many years of practice at stalking animals under similar conditions-nowhere in\n0z was the sun as much an adversary as in the Thousand Year Grasslands. He knew to squint his eyes\nand follow the persistence of motion, and forget about identifying by shape. He also knew how to\nduck sideways without tipping over or losing his balance, how to crouch suddenly, how to look for\nother clues that the prey had begun to move again-the startled birds, the change in sound, the\ndisrupted wind. She could not lose him, and she could not know he was on her trail.\nSo he wound halfway across the city, from the elegant city centre to the low-rent warehouse\ndistrict, in whose shadowy doorways the destitute made their malodorous homes. Within spitting\ndistance of an army barracks, Elphaba stopped before a boarded-up corn exchange, ferreted a key\nfrom some inner pocket, and opened the door.\nHe caited from a short distance, in an ordinary voice-\u201cFabala!\u201d Even in the act of turning she\ncaught herself and tried to rearrange her expression. But it was too late. She had shown that she\nrecognized him, and she realized it. His foot was blocking the way before she could slam the heavy\ndoor shut.\n\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d she said, \u201cplease. Please.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, let me in.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re trouble. Stay out.\u201d Pure Elphaba. His last doubts fled. He cracked the door open with\nhis shoulder.\n\u201cYou\u2019re making me into a monster,\u201d he said, grunting with the effort-she was strong. \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to rob you or rape you. I just- won\u2019t-be ignored like that. Why?\u201d\nShe gave up then, and he fell stupidly against the unplastered brick wall of the stairwell, like a\npratfalling twit in a vaudeville hour. \u201cI remem\nbered you as full of delicacy and grace,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you catch something by accident, or did\nyou study awkwardness?\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201cyou force someone to behave like a clumping boor, you give them no\nchoice. Don\u2019t be so surprised. I can still manage grace. I can do delicacy. Half a minute.\u201d\n\u201cShiz got to you,\u201d she said, eyebrows up, but mockingly; she wasn\u2019t really surprised. \u201cListen to\nthose graduate school affectations. Where\u2019s the native boy reeking that appealing naivete like a wellchosen musk?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking well too,\u201d he said, a bit hurt. \u201cDo you live in this stairwell or are we going\nsomeplace even a little bit homey?\u201d\nShe cursed and mounted the stairs; they were covered with mouse turds and scraps of packing\nstraw. A soupy evening light seeped in the grimy gray glass windows. At a bend in the stairs a white\ncat was waiting, haughty and disaffected like all its kin. \u201cMalky, Malky, miaow miaow,\u201d said\nElphaba as she passed it, and it deigned to follow her up to the pointy arched doorway at the top of\nthe stairs.\n\u201cYour familiar?\u201d said Fiyero.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWell, I\u2019d as soon be thought a witch as anything else. Why not.\nHere Malky, some milk.\u201d\nThe room was large and seemed only casually arranged for dwelling. Originally a storeroom, it\nhad barricaded double doors that could be swung outward, to receive or dispense sacks of grain\nhauled up by a winch from the street. The only natural light fell in through a couple of cracked panes\nof glass in a skylight open four or five inches. Pigeon feathers and white-and-bloody flux on the floor\nbelow. Eight or ten crates in a circle, as if for sitting. A bedroll. Clothes folded on a trunk. Some\nodd feathers, bits of bones, strung teeth, and a wizened dodo claw, brown and twisted like beefjerky:\nThese were hung on nails pounded into the wall, and arranged for art or for a spell. A sallowwood\n\n\ftable-a nice piece of furniture, that!-whose three arching legs tapered down into elegantly carved\ndoe\u2019s hooves. A few tin plates, red with white speckles, some food wrapped in cloth and cord. A\npile of books at the bedside. A cat toy tied to a string. Most effectively, and gruesomely, the skull of\nan elephant hung on a rafter, and a bouquet of dried creamy pink roses emerged from the central hole\nin the hull of its cranium-like the exploding brains of a dying animal, he couldn\u2019t help thinking,\nremembering Elphaba\u2019s youthful\nconcerns. Or maybe an homage to the putative magical talents of elephants?\nBelow it hung a crude glass oval, scratched and chipped, used as a looking glass, perhaps,\nthough its reflective qualities appeared unreliable.\n\u201cSo this is home,\u201d said Fiyero as Elphaba brought out some food for the cat and ignored Fiyero\nsome more.\n\u201cAsk me no questions and I\u2019ll spell you no lies,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMay I sit down?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question\u201d-but she was grinning-\u201coh, well then, sit for ten minutes and tell me about\nyourself. How did you of all people turn into a sophisticate?\u201d\n\u201cAppearances are deceiving,\u201d he said. \u201cI can afford the garb and affect the language, but I\u2019m\nstill an Arjiki tribal boy underneath.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your life like?\u201d\n\u201cIs there something to drink? Not alcohol-I\u2019m just thirsty.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have running water. I don\u2019t use it. There\u2019s some questionable milk-at least Malky will\nstill drink it-or perhaps there\u2019s a bottle of ale upthere on the shelf-help yourself.\u201d\nShe took a little ale in a pipkin, left the rest for him.\nHe told her the barest outline of things. His wife, Sarima, the childhood bride grown up and\ngrown fecund-their three children. The old Office of Public Works waterworks headquarters at\nKiamo Ko, which by ambush and occupation his father had converted to a chieftain\u2019s seat and a\ntribal stronghold back in the time of the Ozma Regent. The dizzying schizoid life of moving every\nyear from the Thousand Year Grasslands in the spring and summer, where the clan hunted and\nfeasted, to a more settled autumn and winter at Kiamo Ko. \u201cAn Arjiki prince has business interests\nhere in the Emerald City?\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIf it were banking you\u2019d be in Shin. The business of this\ncity is military, my old friend. What are you up to?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard enough from me,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play coy and deceptive too, even if it\u2019s all\npretend and no dark secrets to speak of.\u201d He guessed the quiet business of trade agreements would\nnot Impress his old friend; he was embarrassed his affairs weren\u2019t more audacious or thrilling. \u201cBut\nI\u2019ve gone on. What of you, Elphie?\u201d\nShe wouldn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes. She unrolled some dried sausage and some\ngraying bread, and found a couple of oranges and\na lemon, and put them unceremoniously on the table. In the mothy atmosphere she looked more\nlike a shadow than a person; her green skin seemed oddly soft, like spring leaves at their tenderest,\nand beaten, like copper. He had an unprecedented urge to grab her wrist and make her stop moving\nabout-if not to make her talk, at least to keep her still, so he could look at her.\n\u201cEat this stuff,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. You eat it, go on.\u201d\n\u201cTell me something,\u201d he begged. \u201cYou left us at Shiz-you disappeared like the morning fog.\nWhy, where to, and what then?\u201d\n\u201cHow poetic you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve a notion that poetry is the highest form of selfdeception.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d\nBut she was agitated. Her fingers twitched; she called for the cat, and then irritated it and sent it\n\n\fflying off her lap. Finally she said, \u201cOh well, this much then. But you\u2019re never to come here again. I\ndon\u2019t want to have to find a new place, this is too good for me. Do you promise?\u201d\n\u201cI will agree to consider promising, that\u2019s all. How can I promise any more than that? I don\u2019t\nknow a thing yet.\u201d\nShe said, hurriedly, \u201cWell, I was fed up with Shin. The death of\nDoctor Dillamond vexed me, and everybody grieved and nobody cared.\nNot really. It wasn\u2019t the right place for me anyway, all those silly girls.\nAlthough I liked Glinda well enough. How is she anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not in touch. I keep expecting to run into her at some Palace reception or other. I hear\nthrough the grapevine that she married a Paltos baronet.\u201d\nElphaba looked annoyed and her back stiffened. \u201cOnly a baronet? Not a baron or a viscount at\nleast? What a disappointment. Her early promise was never to pan out, then.\u201d Meant as a joke, her\nremark was stiff and unfunny. \u201cIs she a mother?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asking the questions now, remember?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but Palace receptions?\u201d she said. \u201cAre you in cahoots with Our Glorious Wizard?\u201d\n\u201cI hear he\u2019s mostly gone reclusive. I\u2019ve never met him,\u201d Fiyero said.\n\u201cHe shows up at the opera and listens behind a portable screen. At his\nown formal dinners he dines apart, in an adjoining chamber behind a\ncarved marble grill. I\u2019ve seen a profile of a stately man walking along a\npromenade. If that\u2019s even the Wizard, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve met of him. But you, you:you. Why did you\ncut us all off?\u201d\n\u201cI loved you too much to keep in touch.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d she said, thrashing a bit, her arms like oars rowing in the blue summer evening\nlightlessness.\n\u201cYes, I am asking. Have you lived here ever since? For five years? Do you study? Do you\nwork?\u201d He rubbed his bare forearms as he tried to guess about her: What would she be up to? \u201cAre\nyou associated with the Animal Relief League, or one of those defiant little humanitarian\norganizations?\u201d\n\u201cI never use the words humanist or humanitarian, as it seems to me that to be human is to be\ncapable of the most heinous crimes in nature.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re evading again.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d she said. \u201cThere, that\u2019s a clue for you, dear Fiyero.\u201d\n\u201cAmplify.\u201d\n\u201cI went underground,\u201d she said softly, \u201cand I am still underground. You\u2019re the first one to crack\nmy anonymity since I said good-bye to Glinda five years ago. So you now know why I can\u2019t say any\nmore, or why you can\u2019t see me again. For all I know you will turn me in to the Gale Force.\u201d\n\u201cHah! Those martinets! You think very little of me if you think I-\u201c\n\u201cHow do I know, how could I know?\u201d She twisted her fingers together, a puzzle of green sticks.\n\u201cThey march in those boots all over the poor and the weak. They terrify households at three in the\nmorning and drag away dissenters-and break up printing presses with their axes-and hold mock trials\nfor treason at midnight and executions at dawn. They rake over every quarter of this beautiful, false\ncity. They harvest a crop of victims on a monthly basis. It\u2019s government by terror. They could be\nmassing on the street right now. Never having yet followed me, they may have followed you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not as hard to follow as you think,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019re good but not that good. I could\nteach you a few things.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you could,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you won\u2019t, for we won\u2019t meet again. It\u2019s too dangerous, for you\n\n\fas well as for me. That\u2019s what I mean when I say I loved you all too much to keep in touch. Do you\nthink the\nGale Force is above torturing friends and family to get at sensitive information? You\u2019ve got a\nwife and children, and I\u2019m merely an old college friend you ran into once. Clever you to have\nfollowed me. Never again, do you hear? I will move ff1 find you\u2019re trailing me. I can pick up right\nnow, and be away in thirty seconds. It\u2019s my training.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re old friends,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not even especially good friends. Don\u2019t turn this into\na sentimental rendezvous. It\u2019s nice to see you but I don\u2019t ever want to see you again. Take care of\nyourself and beware high connections with bastards, because when the revolution comes there won\u2019t\nbe mercy for toadying ass-lickers.\u201d\n\u201cAt what-twenty three years old?-you\u2019re playing the Lady Rebel?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not becoming.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbecoming,\u201d she agreed. \u201cA perfect word for my new life. Unbecoming. I who have\nalways been unbecoming am becoming un. Though I point out you are the same age as I, and prancing\nabout as a prince. But have you eaten enough? We have to say good-bye now.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d he said, firmly. He wanted to take her hands in his- he didn\u2019t remember that he\u2019d\never touched her before. He corrected himself-he knew he never had.\nIt was almost as if she could read his mind. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t\nknow who I am. You can\u2019t-I mean you can\u2019t and you can\u2019t-it\u2019s not allowed, for one, and you\u2019re not\ncapable for the other. Godspeed, if they use that phrase in the Vinkus-if it\u2019s not a curse. Godspeed,\nFiyero.\u201d\nShe handed him his opera cape, and held out her hand to shake his. He grabbed her hand, and\nlooked up into her face, which just for a second had fallen open. What he saw there made him chill\nand hot flash, in dizzying simultaneity, with the shape and scale of its need.\n\u201cWhat do you hear of Boq?\u201d she asked, the next time they met.\n\u201cYou just won\u2019t answer me anything about yourself, will you?\u201d he said. He was lounging with\nhis feet up on her table. \u201cWhy did you finally agree to let me come back if you keep yourself locked\nup like a prisoner?\u201d\n\u201cI rather liked Boq, that\u2019s all.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI let you come back so I could pump you for news\nof him, and of the others.\u201d\nHe told her what he knew. Boq had married Miss Milla, of all surprising turns. She had been\ndragged out to Nest Hardings, and she hated it. She kept trying suicide. \u201cHis letters sent at\nLurlinemas every year are hysterical; they annotate her failed attempts at killing herself like a sort of\nannual family report.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes me wonder, in the same circumstances, what my mother must have gone through,\u201d said\nElphaba. \u201cThe privileged childhood in the big home of the ascendancy, then the rude shock of a hard\nlife out there in nowhere-land. In Mama\u2019s case, from Colwen Grounds to Rush Margins, then the\nQuadling lowlands. It\u2019s actually a penance of the most severe sort.\u201d\n\u201cLike mother like daughter,\u201d said Fiyero. \u201cHaven\u2019t you left a certain amount of privilege\nyourself, to live here like a snail? Hidden and private?\u201d\n\u201cI remember the first time I saw you,\u201d she said, shaking drops of vinegar over the roots and\nvegetables she was preparing for a supper. \u201cIt was in that lecture hall of what\u2019s-his-name-Doctor .\n\u201cDoctor Nikidik,\u201d said Fiyero. He blushed.\n\u201cYou had those beautiful markings on your face-I\u2019d never seen such before. Did you plan that\nentrance, to win your way into our hearts?\u201d\n\u201cOn my honor, could I have done anything else, I would have. I was both mortified and\nterrified. Do you know, I thought those enchanted antlers were going to kill me? And it was prancing\n\n\fCrope and ffibberty Tibbett who saved me.\u201d\n\u201cCrope and Tibbett! Tibbett and Crope! I\u2019d forgotten all about them. How are they?\u201d\n\u201cTibbett was never the same after that escapade at the Philosophy Club. Crope, I think, entered\nan arts auction house, and still ffits around with the theatrical set. I see him from time to time at\noccasions. We don\u2019t speak.\u201d\n\u201cMy, you\u2019re disapproving!\u201d She laughed. \u201cOf course being as prurient as the next creature I\nalways wondered what the Philosophy Club had turned out to be like. You know, in another life I\u2019d\nlike to see them all again. And Glinda, dear Glinda. And even nasty Avaric. What of him?\u201d\n\u201cAvaric I do speak to. He\u2019s most of the year installed in the Margreavate, but he has a house in\nShin. And when in the Emerald City we stay at the same club.\u201d\n\u201cIs he still a smug boor?\u201d\n\u201cMy,you\u2019re disapproving now.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d They ate their dinner. Fiyero waited for her to ask more about his family. But\nit was their respective families they were keeping from each other, apparently: his Vinkus wife and\nchildren, her circle of agitators and insurrectionists.\nThe next time he came, he thought, he must wear a shirt open at the neck, so she could see that\nthe pattern of blue diamonds on his face continued unbroken down his chest. . . Since she seemed to\nlike that.\n\u201cSurely you don\u2019t spend the entire autumn season in the Emerald City?\u201d she asked one evening\nwhen the cold was drawing in.\n\u201cI\u2019ve send word to Sarima that business is keeping me here indefinitely. She doesn\u2019t care. How\ncould she care? Plucked out of a filthy caravansary and married as a small child to an ArjikI prince?\nHer family wasn\u2019t stupid. She\u2019s got food, servants, and the solid stone walls of Kiamo Ko for\ndefense against the other tribes. She\u2019s going a little fat after her third child. She doesn\u2019t really notice\nwhether I\u2019m home or not-well, she has five sisters, and they all moved in. I married a harem.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Elphaba sounded intrigued and a little embarrassed at the idea.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, no, not really. Sarima has proposed once or twice that her younger sisters could\nand would happily occupy my energies at nighttime. Once you pass over the Great Kells, the taboo\nagainst such an exercise isn\u2019t as strong as it seems to be in the rest of Oz, so stop looking so\nshocked.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Did you do it?\u201d\n\u201cDid I \u2018do it\u2019?\u201d He was teasing her.\n\u201cDid you sleep with your sisters-in-law?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot out of lofty moral standards, or a lack of interest, either. It\u2019s just that\nSarima is a shrewd wife, and everything in marriage is a campaign. I would have been in her thrall\neven more than I am.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a bad thing?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not married, you don\u2019t know: Yes, a bad thing.\u201d\n\u201cI am married,\u201d she said, \u201cjust not to a man.\u201d\nHe raised his eyebrows. She put her hands to her face. He\u2019d never seen\nher look like that-her words had shocked herself. She had to turn her head away for an instant,\nclear her throat, blow her nose. \u201cOh damn, tears, they burn like fire,\u201d she cried, suddenly in a fury,\nand ran for an old blanket to dab her eyes before the salty wetness could run down her cheeks.\nShe stood bent over like an old woman, one arm on the counter, the blanket falling from her face\nto the floor. \u201cElphie, Elphie,\u201d he said, horrified, and lurched after her, and put his arms around her.\nThe blanket hung between them, chin to anides, but seemed about to burst into flame itself, or roses,\nor a fountain of champagne and incense. Odd how the richest images bloomed in the mind when the\n\n\fbody itself was most alert..\n\u201cNo,\u201d she cried, \u201cno, no, I\u2019m not a harem, I\u2019m not a woman, I\u2019m not a person, no.\u201d But her arms\nwheeled of their own accord, like windmill sails, like those magicked antlers, not to kill him, but to\npin him with love, to mount him against the wall.\nMalky, with a rare display of discretion, climbed to the windowsill and looked away from\nthem.\nThey conducted their love affair in the room above the abandoned corn exchange as the autumn\nweather came lop-leggedly in from the east: now a warm day, now a sunny one, now four days of\ncold winds and thin rain.\nThere were long days in a row when they couldn\u2019t meet. \u201cI have business, I have work, trust me\nor I shall disappear on you,\u201d she said. \u201cI shall write to Glinda and ask her to share the spell on how\nto go up in a puff of smoke. I am teasing, but I mean it, Fiyero.\u201d\nFijero + Fae he wrote, in the flour that spilled when she rolled out a piecrust. Fae, she had\nwhispered, as if even to keep it from the cat, was her code name. No one in the cell could know one\nanother\u2019s real names.\nShe would not let him see her naked in the light, but since he also was not allowed to visit\nduring the day this was hardly a problem. She waited for him on the appointed evenings, sitting\nnaked under the blanket, reading essays on political theory or moral philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\nunderstand them, I read them as poetry,\u201d she once admitted. \u201cI like the sound of the words, but I don\u2019t\never really expect my slow, slanted impression of the world to change by what I read.\u201d\n\u201cIs it changing by how you live?\u201d he asked, turning down the light and slippinr out of his\nclothes.\n\u201cYou think all this is new to me,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cYou think I am such a virgin.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bleed the first time,\u201d he observed. \u201cSo what\u2019s to think about?\u201d\n\u201cI know what you think,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how experienced are you, Lord Sir Fiyero, Arjiki\nPrince of Kiamo Ko, Mightiest Stalker of the Thousand Year Grasslands, Chiefest Chieftain in the\nGreat Kells?\u201d\n\u201cI am putty in your hands,\u201d he said, truthfully. \u201cI married a child bride and to preserve my\npower I haven\u2019t been unfaithful. Until now. You are not like her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like her, it\ndoesn\u2019t feel the same. You\u2019re more secret.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said, \u201cso you\u2019re still not being unfaithful, either.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not be unfaithful right now then,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d running his hands along her ribs,\ndown the tight plane of her stomach. She always brought his hands to her thin, expressive breasts;\nshe would not be touched below the waist by hands. They moved together, blue diamonds on a green\nfield.\nHe didn\u2019t have enough to do during the days. Being the chieftain of the Arjiki people, he knew it\nwas in their political interest to be tied ineluctably to the commercial hub of the Emerald City. Yet\nAijiki business concerns only required Fiyero to show his face at social engagements, in board\nmeetings and financial parlors. The rest of the time he wandered about, seeking frescoes of Saint\nGlinda and other saints. Elphaba-Fabala-Elphie-Fae would never tell him what she had been doing\nin the chapel of Saint Glinda attached to the mauntery in Saint Glinda\u2019s Square.\nOne day he looked up Avaric and they had lunch. Avaric suggested a girlie show afterward, and\nFiyero begged off. Avaric was opinionated, cynical, corrupt, and as good-looking as ever. There\nwasn\u2019t much gossip to bring back to Elphaba.\nThe wind tore the leaves from the trees. The Gale Force continued to frog-march Animals and\ncollaborators out of town. Interest rates in the Gillikin banks went soaring up-good for investors, bad\nfor those who had adjustable rate loans. Foreclosures on a lot of valuable city-centre properties.\n\n\fToo early, businesses began stringing the green and gold lights\nof Lurlinemas, trying to woo cautious and depressed citizens into the shops.\nMore than anything else he wanted to walk the streets of the Emerald City with Elphaba-there\nwas no more beautiful place to be in love, especially at dusk as the shop lights went on, golden\nagainst the blue-purple evening sky. He had never been in love before, he now saw. It humbled him.\nIt scared him. He couldn\u2019t bear it when their forced absence went four or five days.\n\u201cKisses to Irji, Manek, and Nor,\u201d he wrote on the bottom of his weekly letter to Sarima, who\ncouldn\u2019t write back because, among other things, she had never learned either alphabet. Somehow\nher silence seemed a tacit approval of this vow-shattering interlude. He didn\u2019t write kisses to her,\ntoo. He hoped the chocolates would do.\nHe rolled over, tugging the blanket with him; she tugged it back. The air in the room was so\ncold it seemed clammy. Malky endured their thrashing legs in order to stay near them, to receive\nwarmth, and to give whatever passes for affection in cats.\n\u201cMy darling Fae,\u201d said Fiyero. \u201cYou probably know this, and I\u2019m not about to become a coconspirator at whatever it is you\u2019re working for-reducing library fines or revoking the need for cat\ncollars or whatever. But I do keep my ears open. The Quadlings are under the thumb of the marching\nmilitia again. At least that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying in the lounge of the club, over newspapers and\npipes. Apparently an army division has gone down into Quadling Country as far as Qhoyre, on some\nsort of a slash-and-burn mission. Your father, your brother, and Nessarose-are they still there?\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t answer for a while. She seemed to be working out not only what she wanted to\nsay, but perhaps even what she could remember. Her expression was of puzzlement, even testiness.\nShe said, \u201cWe lived in Qhoyre for a time, when I was about ten. It\u2019s a funny little low town, built on\nboggy ground. Half the streets are canals. The roofs are low, the windows are grilled or louvred to\nprovide privacy and ventilanon, the air is steamy and the flora excessive-huge roundels of palmy\nleaf, almost like shallow quilted pillows, making a sound as they beat against each other in the windtirrr tirrr, tirrr tirrr.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s much of Qhoyre left,\u201d said FIyero carefully. \u201cIf the gossip I picked up\nis accurate.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Papa isn\u2019t there now, thank-thank whoever, whatever, thank nothing,\u201d continued Elphaba.\n\u201cUnless things have changed. The good people of Qhoyre weren\u2019t very responsive to missionary\nefforts. They\u2019d invite Papa and me in, serve us little damp cakelets and lukewarm red mint tea. We\u2019d\nall sit on low, mildewing cushions, scaring geckos and spiders into the deeper shadows. Papa would\ndrone on about the generous nature of the Unnamed God, doing his basic xenophiiac slant. He\npointed to me as proof. I would grin with horrible sweetness and sing a hymn-the only music Papa\napproved of. I was miserably shy and ashamed of my color, but Papa had convinced me of the value\nof this work. Invariably the gentle citizens of Qhoyre would capitulate out of hospitality. They\u2019d\nallow themselves to be led in prayers to the Unnamed God, but you couldn\u2019t say their hearts were in\nit. I think I sensed a great deal more-more dishearteningiy than Papa did-how ineffectual we really\nwere.\u201d\n\u201cSo where are they now? Papa, Nessarose, and the boy-your brother, what\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\u201cShell, that\u2019s his name. Well, Papa felt his work was farther south in Quadling Country, in the\nreal outback. We had a series of small cramped homes around Ovvels-the Hovels in Ovvels, we\ncalled them- that dreary, beastly countryside, full of a bloody beauty.\u201d\nAt his questioning expression she continued. \u201cI mean, fifteen, twenty years ago, Fiyero, the\nEmerald City speculators discovered the ruby deposits there. First under the Ozma Regent, then after\nthe coup, under the Wizard: same ugly business practices. Though under the Ozma Regent the\nexploitation did not require murder and brutality. Using elephants, the engineers hauled in gravel,\n\n\fthey dammed up springs, they perfected a complicated system of strip mining under three feet of\nbrackish groundwater. Papa thought this disarray in their little moist society was a situation readymade for mission work. And he was right. The Quadlings struggled against the Wizard with illargued proclamations, they resorted to totems, but their only military weapons were slingshots. So\nthey rallied around my father. He converted them, they went into the struggle with the zeal of the\nnewly chastised. They were dispossessed and disappeared. All with the benefit of unionist grace.\u201d\n\u201cMy, you\u2019re bitter.\u201d\n\u201cI was a tool. My dear father used me-and Nessarose less so, because of her trouble moving\nabout-he used me as an object lesson. Looking as I did, even singing as I can-they trusted him partly\nas a response to the freakiness of me. If the Unnamed God could love me, how much more\nresponsible it\u2019d be to the unadulterated them.\u201d\n\u201cSo, my dear, you don\u2019t care where he is, or what happens to him now?\u201d\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d She sat up, steaming. \u201cI love the mad old tunnel-visioned bastard. He\nreally believed in what he preached. He even thought that a Quadling corpse found floating faceup in\na brackwater pond-provided it had a tattoo of conversion on it somewhere-was better off than a\nsurvivor. He felt he\u2019d written a single ticket to the Other Land assembly of the Unnamed God. I think\nhe considered it work well done.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d Fiyero had a fairly anemic spiritual life; he felt unqualified to voice an\nopinion about her father\u2019s vocation.\n\u201cMaybe it was work well done,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cHow do I know? But not for me. Settlement\nby settlement we reaped converts. Settlement by settlement the civil engineering corps came in, to\ndetonate the village life. There was no outcry throughout Oz proper. Nobody was listening. Who\ncared about the Quadlings?\u201d\n\u201cBut what brought him there in the first place?\u201d\n\u201cHe and Mama had had a friend, a Quadling, who died in my family home-a Quadling itinerant,\na glassblower.\u201d Elphaba frowned and closed her eyes, and would say no more. Fiyero kissed her\nfingernails. He kissed the V between her thumb and forefinger, he sucked on it as if it were a lemon\nrind. She slipped backward to allow him greater purchase.\nA while later he said, \u201cBut Elphie-Fabala-Fae-are you really not worried about your father and\nNessarose, and little himmy-who?\u201d\n\u201cMy father chases hopeless causes. It gives his failure at life some legitimacy. For a while he\nproclaimed himself a prophet of the return of the last, lost tadpole of the Ozma line. That\u2019s over now.\nAnd my brother Shell-he is probably fifteen by now. Look Fiyero, how can I be worried about them\nand be worried about the campaign of the season too? I can\u2019t course around Oz-on that broomstick\nthere, like a storybook witch!I\u2019ve chosen to go underground so that I can\u2019t worry. Besides, I know what will happen to\nNessarose at least. Sooner or later.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhen my great-grandfather finally pops off, she\u2019ll be the next Eminent Thropp.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in line, I thought. Aren\u2019t you older?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gone, deane, I\u2019m magicked away in a puff of smoke. Forget it. And you know, that\u2019lI be\ngood for Nessarose. She\u2019ll be a sort of local queen out there in Nest Hardings.\u201d\n\u201cShe apparently did a course in sorcery, did you know? In Shin?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Well, bully for her. If she ever comes down off that plinth-the one that has words\nwritten on it along the edges in gold, reading MOST SUPERIOR IN MORAL RECTITUDE-if she\never allows herself to be the bitch she really is, she\u2019ll be the Bitch of the East. Nanny and the\ndevoted staff at Coiwen Grounds will prop her up.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI thought you were fond of her!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know affection when you see it?\u201d scoffed Elphaba. \u201cI love Nessie. She\u2019s a pain in\nthe neck, she\u2019s intolerably righteous, she\u2019s a nasty piece of work. I\u2019m devoted to her.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be the Eminent Thropp.\u201d\n\u201cBetter she than I,\u201d said Elphaba dryly. \u201cFor one thing, she has great taste in shoes.\u201d\nOne evening through the skylight the full moon fell heavily on Elphaba sleeping. Fiyero had\nawakened and gone to take a leak into the chamber pot. Malky was stalking mice on the stairs.\nComing back, Fiyero looked at the form of his lover, more pearly than green tonight. He had brought\nher a traditional Vinkus fringed silk scarf-roses on a black background-and he had tied it around her\nwaist, and from then on it was a costume for lovemaking. Tonight in sleeping she had nudged it up,\nand he admired the curve of her flank, the tender fragility of her knee, the bony ankle. There was a\nsmell of perfume still in the air, and the resiny, animal smell, and the smell of the mystical sea, and\nthe sweet cloaking smell of hair all riled up by sex. He sat by the side of the bed and looked at her.\nHer pubic hair grew, almost more purple than black, in small spangled curls, a different pattern than\nSarima\u2019s. There was an\nodd shadow near the groin-for a sleepy moment he wondered if some of his blue diamonds had,\nin the heat of sex, been steamed onto her own skin-or was it a scar?\nBut she woke up just then, and in the moonlight covered herself with a blanket. She smiled at\nhim drowsily and called him \u201cYero, my hero,\u201d and that melted his heart.\nShe could get so angry, though!\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the pork roll you\u2019re devouring, in such perfect mindless affluence, is\ncut from a Pig,\u201d she snapped at him once.\n\u2018just because you\u2019ve already eaten, you don\u2019t need to ruin my appetite,\u201d he protested mildly.\nFree-living Animals were not much in evidence in his home territory, and the few sentient creatures\nhe\u2019d known at Shin had, except at the Philosophy Club that night, made little impression. The plight\nof the Animals had not much touched him.\n\u201cThis is why you shouldn\u2019t fall in love, it blinds you. Love is wicked distraction.\u201d\n\u201cNow you have put me off my lunch.\u201d He fed the rest of the pork roll to Malky. \u201cWhat in the\nworld do you know about wickedness? You\u2019re a bit player in this network of renegades, aren\u2019t you?\nYou\u2019re a novice.\u201d\n\u201cI know this: The wickedness of men is that their power breeds stupidity and blindness,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\u201cAnd of women?\u201d\n\u201cWomen are weaker, but their weakness is full of cunning and an equally rigid moral certainty.\nSince their arena is smaller, their capacity for real damage is less alarming. Though being more\nintimate they are the more treacherous.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my capacity for evil?\u201d said Fiyero, feeling implicated and uncomfortable. \u201cAnd yours?\u201d\n\u201cFiyero\u2019s capacity for evil is in believing too strenuously in a capacity for good.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yours?\u201d\n\u201cMine is in thinking in epigrams.\u201d\n\u201cYou let yourself off lightly,\u201d he said, suddenly a little annoyed. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re engaged\nby your secret network to do? Generate witty epigrams?\u201d\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s big doings afoot,\u201d she said, uncharacteristically. \u201cI won\u2019t be at the center of it, but\nI\u2019ll be on the fringes helping out, believe me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? A coup?\u201d\n\u201cNever you mind, and you\u2019ll stay blameless. Just as you want to be.\u201d This was nastiness on her\npart.\n\n\f\u201cAn assassination? And so what if you do kill some General Butcher? What does that make\nyou? A saint? A saint of the revolution? Or a martyr if you\u2019re killed in the campaign?\u201d\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer. She shook her narrow head in irritation, then flung the rosy shawl across\nthe room as if it infuriated her.\n\u201cWhat if some innocent bystander is killed as you aim for General Pig Butcher?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know or care much about martyrs,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that smacks of a higher plan, a\ncosmology-something I don\u2019t believe in. If we can\u2019t comprehend the plan at hand, how could a\nhigher plan make any more sense? But were I to believe in martyrdom, I suppose I\u2019d say you can\nonly be a martyr if you know what you are dying for, and choose it.\u201d\n\u201cAh, so then there are innocent victims in this trade. Those who don\u2019t choose to die but are in\nthe line of fire.\u201d\n\u201cThere are . . . there will be . . . accidents, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cCan there be grief, regret, in your exalted circle? Is there any such thing as a mistake? Is there\na concept of tragedy?\u201d\n\u201cFiyero, you disaffected fool, the tragedy is all around us. Worrying about anything smaller is a\ndistraction. Any casualty of the struggle is their fault, not ours. We don\u2019t embrace violence but we\ndon\u2019t deny its existence-how can we deny it when its effects are all around us? That kind of denial is\na sin, if anything is-\u201c\n\u201cAh-now I\u2019ve heard the word I never expected to hear you say.\u201d\n\u201cDenial? Sin?\u201d\n\u201cNo. We.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why-\u201c\n\u201cThe lone dissenter at Crage Hall turns institutional? A company gal? A team player? Our\nformer Miss Queen of Solitaire?\u201d\n\u201cYou misunderstand. There is a campaign but no agents, there is a game but no players. I have\nno colleagues. I have no self I never did, in\nfact, but that\u2019s beside the point. I am just a muscular twitch in the larger organism.\u201d\n\u201cHah! You the most individual, the most separate, the most real .\n\u201cLike everyone else you refer to my looks. And you make fun of them.\u201d\n\u201cI adore your looks and I acknowledge them. Fae!\u201d\nThey parted that day without speaking, and he spent the evening at the betting parlor, losing\nmoney.\nThe next time he saw her, he brought three green candles and three gold candles and decorated\nher flat for Lurlinemas. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in religious feast days,\u201d she said, but relented to admit, \u201cthey\nare pretty, though.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no soul,\u201d he teased her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she answered soberly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it showed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re only playing word games now.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat proof have I of a soul?\u201d\n\u201cHow can you have a conscience if you don\u2019t have a soul?\u201d he asked despite himself-he wanted\nto keep things light, to get back onto a better footing after their last episode of moral wrestling and\nestrangement.\n\u201cHow can a bird feed its young if it has no consciousness of before and after? A conscience,\nYero my hero, is only consciousness in another dimension, the dimension of time. What you call\nconscience I prefer to call instinct. Birds feed their young without understanding why, without\nweeping about how all that is born must die, sob sob. I do my work with a similar motivation: the\nmovement in the gut toward food, fairness, and safety. I am a pack animal wheeling with the herd,\n\n\fthat\u2019s all. I\u2019m a forgettable leaf on a tree.\u201d\n\u201cSince your work is terrorism, that\u2019s the most extreme argument for crime I\u2019ve ever heard.\nYou\u2019re eschewing all personal responsibility. It\u2019s as bad as those who sacrifice their personal will\ninto the gloomy morasses of the unknowable will of some unnameable god. If you suppress the idea\nof personhood then you suppress the notion of individual culpability.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is worse, Fiyero? Suppressing the idea of personhood or suppressing, through torture\nand incarceration and starvation, real living persons? Look: Would you worry about saving one\nprecious sentimental por\ntrait in a museum of fine arts when the city around you is on fire and real people are burning to\ndeath? Keep some proportion in all this!\u201d\n\u201cBut even some innocent bystander-say an annoying society dame-is a real person, not a\nportrait. Your metaphor is distracting and belittling, it\u2019s a blind excuse for crime.\u201d\n\u201cA society dame has chosen to parade herself as a living portrait. She must be treated as such.\nIt\u2019s her due. That denial of it, that\u2019syour evil, to go back to the other day. I say you save the innocent\nbystander if you can, even if she\u2019s a society dame, or he\u2019s a captain of industry thriving mightily on\nall these repressive moves-but not, not, not at the expense of other, realer people. And if you can\u2019t\nsave them, you can\u2019t. Everything costs.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in this concept of \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018realer\u2019 people.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d She smiled, not nicely. \u201cWhen I do disappear again, deane, I\u2019ll surely be less real\nthan I am now.\u201d She made to simulate sex against him; he turned his head, surprised at the vigor of\nhis aversion.\nLater that night, when they had made up, she suffered a racking paroxysm and painful sweats.\nShe would not let him touch her. \u201cYou should go away, I\u2019m not worthy of you,\u201d she moaned, and\nsome time later, when she was calmer, she murmured before sleeping again, \u201cI love you so much,\nFiyero, you just don\u2019t understand: Being born with a talent or an inclination for goodness is the\naberration.\u201d\nShe was right. He didn\u2019t understand. He wiped her brow with a dry towel and kept close to her.\nThere was frost on the skylight, and they slept beneath their winter coats to keep warm.\nOne brisk afternoon he sent off a propitiatory package of bright wooden toys for the children\nand a jeweled torque for Sarima. The pack train was going around the Great Kells via the northern\nroute. It wouldn\u2019t deliver Lurlinemas presents to Kiamo Ko until well into the spring, but he could\npretend to have sent them earlier. If the snows held off, he would be home by then, restless and\nchafing in the tall narrow rooms of the mountain stronghold, but maybe he would get the credit for\nthoughtfulness. And perhaps deserved, why not? To be sure, Sanima would be in her winter\ndoldrums (as distinct from her spring moods, her summer ennui, and\nher congenital autumn condition). A torque eventually would cheer her up, at least a little.\nHe stopped for a coffee in a cafe in a neighborhood just enough off the beaten track to be both\nbohemian and pricey. The management apologized:\nThe winter garden, usually heated with braziers and brazen with expensive forced flowers, had\nbeen the site of an explosion the night before. \u201cThe neighborhood is troubled; who\u2019d have thought\nit?\u201d said the manager, touching Fiyero on the elbow. \u201cOur Glorious Wizard was to have eradicated\ncivil unrest: wasn\u2019t that the whole point of curfews and containment laws?\u201d\nFiyero was not inclined to comment, and the manager took his silence for agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve\nmoved a few tables into my private parlor up the stairs, if you don\u2019t mind roughing it amidst my\nfamily memorabilia,\u201d he said, leading the way. \u201cFinding good Munchkinlander help to repair the\ndamage is getting harder, too. The Munchkinlander tiktok touch, there\u2019s nothing like it. But a lot of\nour friends in the service sector have \u2018gone back to their eastern farms. Scared of violence against\n\n\fthem-well, so many of them are so small, don\u2019t you think they seem to provoke it?- they\u2019re all\ncowards.\u201d He interrupted himself to say, \u201cI can tell you have no Munchkinlander relatives or I\nwouldn\u2019t comment this way.\u201d\n\u201cMy wife is from Nest Hardings,\u201d said Fiyero, lying unconvincingly, but the point was made.\n\u201cI recommend the cherry chocolate frappe today, fresh and delicious,\u201d said the manager,\nretreating into repentant formality, and pulling out a chair at a table near high old windows. Fiyero\nsat and looked out. One fretted shutter had warped and couldn\u2019t fold back against the outer wall as\ndesigned, but there was still enough of a view. Rooflines, ornamental chimney pots, the odd high\nwindow box stuffed with dark winter pansies, and pigeons swooping and scissoring like lords of the\nsky.\nThe manager was of that peculiar stock; after so many generations in the Emerald City, it\nseemed a separate ethnic strand. The paintings of his family showed the bright gimlet hazel eyes, and\nrefined receding hairlines on men and women alike (and plucked into the scalps of children, too, in\nthe fashion of the Emerald City upwardly yearning middle class). At the sight of simpering boys in\npink satin with frizzy-headed lapdogs, and girlettes in womanish dark rouge and plunging necklines\n(revealing their innocent lack of breasts), Fiyero felt the sudden longing, again, for\nhis own cold and distant children. Though bruised by their particular family life-and who\nwasn\u2019t?-in his memory Irji, Manek, and Nor managed more integrity than these hothouse scions of a\nfamily on the make.\nBut that was cruel, and he was responding to artistic convention, not to the actual children. He\nturned his gaze out the window when the order came, to avoid hideous art, to avoid the other people\nin the salon.\nHaving coffee in the winter garden below usually provided a view of vine-covered brick walls,\nshrubs, and the occasional marble statue of some improbably beautiful and vulnerably naked\nstripling. However, from a flight up, one could see over the wall, into an interior mews area. One\npart was a stables, another a neighborhood toilet, apparently; and just within the range of his vision\nwas the wall broken by the explosion. Some sort of twisted, thorny wire netting had been erected\nacross the opening, which led into a schoolyard.\nAs he watched, one of the doors of the adjacent school was pushed open, and a small crowd\nemerged, shaking and stretching into the sunlight. There seemed to be-Fiyero peered-a couple of\nelderly Quadling women and some adolescent male Quadlings, straplings with early mustaches\nmaking a bluish-colored shadow against their fine rose-rust skin. Five, six, seven Quadlings-and a\ncouple of stout men who might have been part Gillikinese, it was hard to tell-and a family of bears.\nNo- Bears. Smallish Red Bears, a mother and father and a toddler.\nThe little Bear went unerringly to some balls and hoops under the stairs. The Quadlings made a\ncircle and began to sing and dance. The old ones, with arthritic steps, joined their hands with the\nteenagers and moved in a widdershins pattern, in and out, as if making a clock face that reversed the\nclockwise movement of time. The stocky Gillikinese men shared a cigarette and gazed out the wiry\nbarrier across the break in the wall. The Red Bears were more dispirited. The male sat on the\nwooden edge of a sandlot, tubbing his eyes and combing the fur below his chin. The female moved\nback and forth, kicking at the ball just often enough to keep the cub occupied, then stroking the bowed\nhead of her mate.\nFiyero sipped his drink and inched forward. If there were, what, twelve prisoners, and only a\nwire fence between them and freedom, why didn\u2019t they rush it? \\Vhy were they separated into their\nracial and species groups?\nAfter ten minutes the doors opened again and a Gale Forcer came\nout, trim and-yes, Fiyero had to admit it at last-terrifyIng. Terrifying in the brick red uniform\n\n\fwith the green boots, and the emerald cross that quartered the breast of the shirt, one vertical strap\nfrom groin to high starched collar, the other strap from armpit to armpit across the pectorals. He was\nonly a youth whose curly hair was so blond as to look nearly white in the winter sun. He stood with\nlegs apart on the step of the school\u2019s verandah.\nThough Fiyero couldn\u2019t hear a thing through the closed window, the soldier apparently gave a\ncommand. The Bears stiffened and the cub began to wail and clutch the ball to itself. The Gillikinese\nmen came and stood quiescently ready. The Quadlings ignored the order and kept on with their\ndance. They swung their hips, and they held their arms at shoulder height, moving their hands in a\nsemaphoric message, though what it meant Fiyero could only guess. He had never seen a Quadling\nbefore.\nThe Gale Forcer raised his voice. He had a truncheon in a thong ioop at his waist. The cub hid\nbehind the father, and the mother could be seen to growl.\nWork together, Fiyero found himself thinking, hardly aware he could have such a thought. Work\nas a team-there are twelve of you and only one of him. Is it your differences from one another that\nkeep you docile? Or are there relatives inside who will be tortured if you make a break for freedom?\nIt was all speculation; Fiyero couldn\u2019t tell the dynamics of the situation, but he was riveted. He\nrealized his hand was open, palm up against the glass of the window. Below, because the Bears had\nnot stood to join the lineup, the soldier raised his cudgel and it came down on the skull of the cub.\nFiyero\u2019s body jerked, he spilled his drink and the cup broke, porcelain shards on the buttery\nherringbone-laid oak flooring.\nThe manager appeared from behind a green baize door and tutted, and twitched the drapes\nclosed, but not before Fiyero had seen one last thing. Recoiling as if he had never hunted and killed\nin the Thousand Year Grasslands, he averted his eyes and they wheeled upward, where he glimpsed\nthe pale blond coins of faces-two or three dozen schoolchildren in the upper windows of the school,\nstaring down with fascination and open mouths at the scene in their playing field.\n\u201cThey have no concern for neighbors who have a business to run,\nbills to pay, and loved ones to feed,\u201d snapped the manager. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to see those antics\nas you enjoy your coffee, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThe disruption in your winter garden,\u201d said Fiyero. \u201cThat was someone trying to break down\nyour wall into that yard, and get them out alive.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t even suggest it,\u201d shot the manager in a low voice. \u201cThere are more ears in this room\nthan yours and mine. How do I know who was up to what, or why? I\u2019m a private citizen and I mind\nmy own business.\u201d\nFiyero didn\u2019t take a replacement cup of cherry chocolate. There were racking cries from the\nmother Bear, and then a silence in the world outside the heavy damask drapes. Was it an accident I\nsaw that, Fiyero wondered, looking at the manager with new eyes. Otis it just that the world unwraps\nitself to you, again and again, as soon as you are ready to see it anew?\nHe wanted to tell Elphie what he had seen, but he held back for reasons he couldn\u2019t name. In\nsome way, in the balance of their affections, he sensed she needed an identity separate from his.\nWere he to become a convert to her cause, she might drift away. He did not dare to risk it. But the\nvision of the battered Bear cub haunted him. He held Elphie the tighter, trying to communicate a\ndeeper passion without speaking it.\nHe noticed, too, that when she was agitated she was the more liberal in her lovemaking. He\nbegan to be able to tell when she was going to say \u201cNot till next week.\u201d She seemed more\nabandoned, more salacious, perhaps as a cleansing exercise before disappearing for a few days. One\nmorning, as he was stealing some of the cat\u2019s milk for his coffee, she rubbed some oil on her skin,\nwincing with sensitivity, and said over her shoulder of soft green marble, \u201cA fortnight, my dear. My\n\n\fpet, as my father used to say. I need a fortnight of privacy now.\u201d\nHe had a sudden pang, a premonition, that she was going to leave him. It was a way for her to\nget two weeks\u2019 head start. \u201cNo!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not on, Fae-Fae. It\u2019s not all right, it\u2019s too long.\u201d\n\u201cWe need it.\u201d She expanded: \u201cNot you and I, I mean the other we. Obviously I can\u2019t tell you\nwhat we\u2019re about, but the last plans for the autumn campaign are falling into place. There\u2019s going to\nbe an episode- I can\u2019t say more-and I must be available to the network at all times.\u201d\n\u201cA coup?\u201d he said. \u201cAn assassination? A bomb? A kidnapping? \\Vhat?Just the nature of it, not\nthe specifics, what?\u201d\n\u201cNot only can I not tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know. I\u2019ll be told only my small part, and\nI\u2019ll do it. I only know it\u2019s a complicated maneuver with a lot of interlocking pieces.\u201d\n\u201cAre you the dart?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you the knife? The fuse?\u201d\nShe said (though he wasn\u2019t convinced): \u201cMy deane, my poppet, I am too green to walk into a\npublic place and do something bad. It\u2019s all too expected. Security guards watch me like owls on a\nmouse. My very presence provokes alarm and heightened vigilance. No, no, the part I\u2019ll play will be\na handmaiden\u2019s part, a little assistance in the shadows.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re selfish,\u201d she said, \u201cand you\u2019re a coward. I love you, my sweet, but your protests about\nthis are wrongheaded. You just want to preserve my insignificant life, you don\u2019t even have a moral\nfeeling about whether I\u2019m doing right or wrong. Not that I want you to, not that I care what you think\nabout it. But I only observe, your objections are of the weakest sort. Now this isn\u2019t something to be\nargued. Two weeks from tonight, come back.\u201d\n\u201cWill the-the action-be completed by then? Who decides?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is yet, and I don\u2019t even know who decides, so don\u2019t ask me.\u201d\n\u201cFae-\u201d Suddenly he didn\u2019t like her code name anymore. \u201cElphaba. Do you really not know who\nis pulling the strings that make you move? How do you know you\u2019re not being manipulated by the\nWizard?\u201d\n\u201cYou are a novice at this, for all your status as a tribal prince!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I\nknow if I was being a pawn of the Wizard? I could tell when I was being manipulated by that\nharridan, Madame Morrible. I learned something about prevarication and straight talking back at\nCrage Hall. Give me the credit for having spent some years at this, Fiyero.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me for sure who is or isn\u2019t the boss.\u201d\n\u201cPapa didn\u2019t know the name of his Unnamed God,\u201d she said, rising and rubbing oil on her\nstomach and between her legs, but modestly turning her back to him. \u201cIt never is the who, is it? It\u2019s\nalways the why.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you hear? How do they tell you what to do?\u201d\n\u201cLook, you know I can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u201cI know you can.\u201d\nShe turned. \u201cOil my breasts, will you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not that stupidly male, Elphaba.\u201d\n\u201cYes you are\u201d-she laughed, but lovingly-\u201ccome on.\u201d\nIt was daylight, the wind roared and even shook the floorboards. The cold sky above the glass\nwas a rare pinkish blue. She dropped her shyness like a nightgown, and in the liquid glare of sunlight\non old boards she held up her hands-as if, in the terror of the upcoming skirmish, she had at last\nunderstood that she was beautiful. In her way.\nThe collapse of her reticence frightened him more than anything else.\nHe took some coconut oil and warmed it between his palms, and slid his hands like leathery\nvelvet animals on her small, responding breasts. The nipples stood, the color flushed. He was\nalready fully dressed, but recklessly he pressed himself against her mildly resisting form. One hand\n\n\fslid down her back; she arched against him, moaning. But perhaps, this time, not from need?\nStill his hand moved down onto her buttocks, felt between her cheeks, beyond, felt the place\none muscle pulled in crookedly, endearingly, felt the very faintest etching of hair beginning its\ncrosshatch shadows, its swirl toward vortex. He worked his intelligent hand, reading the signs of her\nresistance.\n\u201cI have four companions,\u201d she said suddenly, wrenching away in a motion soft enough not to\ndisengage but to discourage. \u201cOh heart, I have four comrades; they don\u2019t know who our cell leader\nis, it\u2019s all done in the dark, with a masking spell to shadow the voice and distort the features. If I\nknew more, the Gale Force could catch me and torture it out of me, don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your object?\u201d he breathed, kissing her, loosening his trousers again, as if this were the\nfirst time, his tongue tracing the twisting funnel of her ear.\n\u201cKill the Wizard,\u201d she answered, looping her legs around him. \u201cI am not the arrowhead, I am\nnot the dart, I am just the shaft, the quiver-\u201d She cupped more oil in her hand and as they slid and fell\ninto the light, she made him bright and anguished with oil, took him deeper in than ever before.\n\u201cEven after all this time, you could be an agent for the Palace,\u201d she said later.\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\nA little snow fell one week, then some more the next. The feast of Lurlinemas drew nearer. The\nunionist chapels, having appropriated and transformed the most visible parts of the old pagan\nbeliefs, hung themselves shamelessly in green and gold, set out green candles and golden gongs and\ngreenberry wreaths and gilded fruit, Along Merchant Row, shops outdid themselves (and the\nchurches) in decor, with displays of fashionable clothes, and useless and expensive trinkets. In\ndisplay windows, papier-machr figures evoked the good Fairy Queen Lurline in her winged chariot,\nand her assistant, the minor fairy Preenella, who strewed gift-wrapped delights from her capacious\nmagic basket.\nHe asked himself, again and again, if he was in love with Elphaba.\nHe also asked himself why he was so late coming to this question, after two months of a\npassionate affair; and if he knew what the words even meant; and if it mattered.\nHe chose more gifts for the kids and for sulky Sarima, that well-fed malcontent, that monster.\nHe missed her a little; his feelings for Elphaba seemed not to vie with those for Sarima, but to\ncomplement them. No two women could be more unlike, Flphaba demonstrated the proud\nindependence of Arjiki mountain women that Sarima, married so young, had never developed. And\nElphie wasn\u2019t just a different (not to say novel) provincial type-she seemed an advance on the\ngender, she seemed a different species sometimes. He caught himself with a mammoth erection just\nremembering that last time, and he had to hide himself behind some ladies\u2019 scarves in a shop until it\nsubsided.\nHe bought three, four, six scarves for Sarima, who didn\u2019t wear scarves. He bought six scarves\nfor Fiphaba, who did.\nThe shop girl, a dull Munchkinlander midget who had to stand on a chair to reach the till, said\nover his shoulder, \u2018just in a minute, ma\u2019am.\u201d He turned to make room at the counter for the other\ncustomer.\n\u201cBut Master Fiyero!\u201d cried Glinda.\n\u201cMiss Glinda,\u201d he said, flabbergasted. \u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d\n\u201cA dozen scarves,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, Crope, look who\u2019s here!\u201d\nAnd there was Crope, a little jowly though he couldn\u2019t be twenty-five yet, could he?-looking\nguiltily up from a display of feathery, plumy things.\n\u201cWe must have tea,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cwe must. Come now. Pay the\nnice little lady and off we fly.\u201d In her voluminous skirts she rustled like a corps of ballerinas.\n\n\fHe hadn\u2019t remembered her quite so giddy; maybe this was married life. He slid a glance at\nCrope, who was rolling his eyes behind her back.\n\u2018just you put this on Sir Chuifrey\u2019s account, and this, and this,\u201d Glinda said, mounding things on\nthe counter, \u201cand have them sent along to our rooms in the Florinthwaite Club. I\u2019ll need them for\ndining so have someone run over with them right now if you would. How dear. So kind. Ta ta. Boys,\ncome along.\u201d\nShe gripped Fiyero with a pinching hand and steered him away; Crope followed like a lapdog.\nThe Florinthwaite Club was only a street or two over and they could easily have carried the\npurchases back themselves. Glinda capered and clattered down the grand staircase into the Oak\nParlor, making enough noise so that every female resident looked up in a rewarding sort of\ndisapproval.\n\u201cNow, you, Crope, there, so you can be Mother and pour when we\u2019ve ordered, and dear Fiyero,\nyou here, right next to me, that is if you\u2019re not too married.\u201d\nThey ordered tea; Glinda got used to him a bit and began to calm down.\n\u201cBut really, who would have thought it?\u201d she said, picking up a biscuit and putting it down\nagain, about eight times in a row. \u201cWe were the great and the good at Shin, really. Look at you,\nFiyero-you\u2019re a prince, aren\u2019t you? Do we call you Your Highness? I never could. And you\u2019re still\nmarried to that little child?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s grown up now, and we have a family,\u201d Fiyero told her warily. \u201cThree children.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s here. I must meet her.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s back at our winter home in the Great Kells.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re having an affair,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cbecause you look so happy. Who with? Anyone I\nknow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to see you;\u201d he said; and in fact he was. She looked wonderful. She had filled\nout some. That wraithlike beauty had bloomed but not coarsened. She was more woman than waif,\nand more wife than woman. Her hair was cut short in a boyish style, very becoming, and there was a\ntiaralike thing in her curls. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re a sorceress.\u201d\n\u201cOh hardiy,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I even get that damned serving girl to hurry up with the scones and\njam? I can not. Yes, I can sign a hundred greeting cards for the holiday season at one go. But it\u2019s a\nvery minor talent, I tell you. Sorcery is vastly overrated in the popular press. Otherwise, why\nwouldn\u2019t the Wizard just magick the hell out of his adversaries? No, I\u2019m content to try to be a good\npartner for my Chuifrey. He\u2019s at the exchange today, doing financial thingies. Oh do you know who\nelse is in town? It\u2019s too rich, Crope tell him.\u201d\nCrope, surprised to be given an opening, choked on his mouthful of tea. Glinda rushed in.\n\u201cNessarose! Can you believe it? She\u2019s at the family home over there in Lower Mennipin Street-an\naddress that\u2019s come up quite a lot in the past decade, I might add. We saw her where, Crope, where?\nIt was the Coffee Emporium-\u201c\n\u201cIt was the Ice Garden-\u201c\n\u201cNo, I remember, it was the Spangletown Cabaret! Fiyero do you know, we went to see that old\nSillipede, do you remember? No you don\u2019t, I can see it in your face. She was the singer who was\nperforming at the Oz Festival of Song and Sentiment the day our Glorious Wizard arrived out of the\nsky in a balloon and orchestrated that coup! She\u2019s making yet another of her innumerable comeback\ntours. She\u2019s a bit camp now but so what, it was gales of fun. And there at a better table than we had,\nI might tell you, was Nessie! She was with her grandfather, or is it the great-grandfather? The\nEminent Thropp? He must be eleventy-hundredy years old by now. I was shocked to see her until I\nrealized she went merely to provide him an escort. She didn\u2019t think much of the music-she scowled\nand prayed all through the entr\u2019acte. And the Nanny was there too. Who would\u2019ve imagined it,\n\n\fFiyero-you\u2019re a prince, and Nessarose just about installed as the next Eminent Thropp, and Avaric,\nof course, the Margreave of Tenmeadows, and humble little me-eee married to Sir Chuffrey, holder\nof the most useless title and the biggest stock portfolio in the Pertha Hills?\u201d Glinda almost stopped\nfor breath, but lunged on kindly, \u201cAnd Crope, of course, dear Crope. Crope, tell Fiyero all about\nyourself, he\u2019s dying to know, I can see it.\u201d\nActually Fiyero was interested, if only for a rest from the staccato chatter.\n\u201cHe\u2019s shy,\u201d Glinda pushed on, \u201cshy shy shy, always was.\u201d Fiyero\nand Crope exchanged glances and tried to keep their mouths from twitching. \u201cHe\u2019s got this so\navant-garde little palace of a loft apartment on the top floor of a doctor\u2019s surgery, could you\nimagine? Stunning views, the best views in the Emerald City, and at this time of year! He dabbles a\nbit in painting, don\u2019t you dear? Painting, a little musical operetta set design here and there. When we\nwere young we thought the world revolved around Shin. You know there\u2019s real theatre here now, the\nWizard has made this a much more cosmopolitan city, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Fiyero,\u201d said Crope, \u201csay something about yourself, fast, before it\u2019s too\nlate.\u201d\n\u201cYou cad, you kid me mercilessiy,\u201d sang Glinda. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him about your little affair with-well\nnever mind. I\u2019m not that mean.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d Fiyero said, feeling even more taciturn and Vinkus than he had when\nhe first arrived in Shin. \u201cI like my life, I lead my clan when they need it, which isn\u2019t often. My\nchildren are healthy. My wife is-well, I don\u2019t know..\n\u201cFertile,\u201d supplied Glinda.\n\u201cYes.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s fertile and I love her, and I\u2019m not going to stay much longer as I\u2019m\nmeeting someone for a business conference across town.\u201d\n\u201cWe must meet,\u201d said Glinda, suddenly plaintive, suddenly looking lonely. \u201cOh Fiyero, we\u2019re\nnot old yet, but we\u2019re old enough to be old friends already, aren\u2019t we? Look, I\u2019ve gushed on like a\ndebutante who forgot to splash on her Eau d\u2019Demure. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that that was such a\nwonderful time, even in its strangeness and sadness-and life isn\u2019t the same now. It\u2019s wonderful, but it\nisn\u2019t the same.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I can meet you again. There\u2019s so little time, and I have to go\nback to Kiamo Ko. I\u2019ve been away since the late summer.\u201d\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re all here, me and Chuifrey, Crope, Nessarose, you-is Avaric around, we could get\nhim? We could get together, we could have a quiet dinner together in our rooms upstairs. I promise\nnot to be so giddy. Please, Fiyero, please, Your Highness. It would do me such an honor.\u201d She\ncocked her head and put a single finger to her chin, elegantly, and he could tell she was struggling\nthrough the language of her class to say something real.\n\u201cIf I think I can, I\u2019ll let you know, but please, you mustn\u2019t count on it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be\nother times. I\u2019m not usually in town so late in the season-this is an anomaly. My children are waitinghave you children, Glinda?\u201d\n\u201cChuifrey is dry as two baked walnuts,\u201d said Glinda, making Crope choke on his tea again.\n\u201cBefore you go-I can see you\u2019re getting ready to dash-dear, dear Fiyero-what do you hear from\nElphaba?\u201d\nBut he was prepared for this, and had readied his face to be blank, and he only said, \u201cNow\nthat\u2019s a name I don\u2019t hear every day. Did she ever turn up? Surely Nessarose must have said.\u201d\n\u201cNessarose says if her sister ever does turn up she\u2019ll spit in her face,\u201d Glinda remarked, \u201cso we\nmust all pray that Nessarose never loses her faith, for that would mean the evaporation of such\ntolerance and kindness. I think she would kill Elphaba. Nessa was abandoned, rejected, left to look\nafter her crazy father, her grandfather-thingy, that brother, that nurse, that house, the staff-and you\n\n\fcan\u2019t even say single-handedly, as she doesn\u2019t have any hands!\u201d\n\u201cI thought I saw Elphaba once,\u201d said Crope.\n\u201cOh?\u201d said Fiyero and Glinda together, and Glinda continued, \u201cYou never told me that, Crope.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on the trolley that runs along the reflecting pool by the Palace. It\nwas raining-some years ago now-and I saw a figure struggling with a big umbrella. I thought she was\nabout to be blown away. A gust of wind blew the umbrella inside out and the face, a greenish face\nwhich is why I noticed, ducked down to avoid the splash of rainwater-you remember how Elphaba\nhated getting wet.\u201d\n\u201cShe was allergic to water,\u201d Glinda opined. \u201cI never knew how she kept herself so clean, and I\nher roommate.\u201d\n\u201cOil, I think,\u201d said Fiyero. They both looked at him. \u201cThat is, in the Vinkus,\u201d he stammered,\n\u201cthe elderly rub oil into their skin instead of water-I\u2019ve always assumed that\u2019s what Elphie did. I\ndon\u2019t know. Glinda, if I were to meet up with you again, what\u2019s a good day?\u201d\nShe rooted in her reticule for a diary. Crope took the opportunity to lean forward and say to\nFiyero, \u201cIt really is good to see you, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou too,\u201d said Fiyero, surprised that he meant it. \u201cIf you ever get\nout into the central Kells, come stay at Kiamo Ko with us.Just send word ahead, as we\u2019re only\nthere for half a year at a time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just your speed, Crope, the wild beasts of the untamed Vinkus,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI think the\nfashion possibilities, all those leather thongs and fringe and such, they might interest you, but I can\u2019t\nsee you as Mister Mountain Boy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, probably not,\u201d agreed Crope. \u201cUnless it affords fabulous cafes every four or five blocks, I\ndon\u2019t think a landscape quite developed enough for human habitation.\u201d\nFiyero shook hands with Crope and then, remembering the rumors about poor Tibbett\u2019s\ndeterioration, kissed him; he threw his arms around Glinda and hugged her hard. She laced her arm\nthrough his and walked him to the door.\n\u201cDo let me shake off Crope and have you back, all to myself,\u201d she said in a low voice, her\npatter evaporating into seriousness. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you, dear Fiyero. The past seems both more\nmysterious and more understandable with you right here before me. I feel there are things I could yet\nlearn. I don\u2019t want to wallow, dear boy, never that! But we go way back.\u201d She held his hand between\nhers. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on in your life. I\u2019m not as dumb as I act. Something good and bad at the\nsame time. Maybe I can help.\u201d\n\u201cYou were always sweet,\u201d he said, and motioned to the doorman to hail a hansom cab. \u201cHow I\nregret that I won\u2019t meet Sir Chuffrey.\u201d\nHe moved out the doorway, across the marble entrance pavement, and turned to tip his hat at\nher. In the doors (the doormen held them open to enhance his parting view) she was a calm, resigned\nwoman, neither transparent nor ineffectual-even, it might have been said, a woman full of grace. \u201cIf\nyou should see her,\u201d said Glinda lightly, \u201ctell her I miss her still.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t see Glinda again. He didn\u2019t call at the Florinthwaite Club. He didn\u2019t stroll past the\nThropp family house in Lower Mennipin Street (though he was sorely tempted). He didn\u2019t stop a\nscalper to try to get one of the tickets to Sillipede\u2019s triumphant fourth annual comeback tour. He\nfound himself in the Chapel of Saint Glinda in Saint Glinda Square, from which he could sometimes\nhear the cloistered maunts next door chanting and susurrating like a swarm of bees.\nWhen the two weeks had passed at last, and the city was worked up to a froth over Lurlinemas,\nhe went to see Elphaba, half-expecting she would have vanished.\nBut there she was, stern and loving and in the midst of making a vegetable pie for him. Her\nprecious Malky was putting his feet in the flour and making paw prints all over the room. They\n\n\ftalked awkwardly until Malky upset the bowl of vegetable stock, and that made them both laugh.\nHe didn\u2019t tell her about Glinda. How could he? Elphaba had worked so hard to keep them all at\nbay, and now she was engaged in the major campaign of her life, the thing she had been working\ntoward for five years. He did not approve of anarchy (well, he knew he was in lazy doubt about\neverything; doubt was much more energy efficient than conviction). But even after seeing the Bear\ncub struck down, he had to keep an even, cautious relationship with the Power on the throne-for the\nsake of his tribe.\nAlso, Fiyero didn\u2019t want to make Elphie\u2019s life harder than it was. And his selfish need to be\ncomfortable with her surmounted his need to gossip. So he didn\u2019t tell her Nessarose and Nanny were\nin town either, or had been. (For all he knew, he rationalized silently, they had already moved on.)\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d she said that night, as the stars peered through the crazy frost pattern on the skylight,\n\u201cI wonder if you should get out of town before Lurlinemas Eve.\u201d\n\u201cIs all hell going to break loose?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know the whole picture; I can\u2019t know; I shouldn\u2019t know. But maybe some\nhell will break loose. Maybe it would be best for you to go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going and you can\u2019t make me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been taking correspondence courses in sorcery on the side, I\u2019ll go puff and turn you into\nstone.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019ll make me hard? I\u2019m already hard.\u201d\n\u201cStop. Stop.\u201d\n\u201cOh you wicked woman, you have bewitched me again, look, it has a mind of its own-\u201c\n\u201cFiyero stop. Stop. Now look, I mean it. I want to know where you\u2019re going to be on\nLurlinemas Eve. Just so I can be sure you\u2019re not going to get hurt. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean we won\u2019t be together?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work night for me,\u2019 she said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you the next day.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait here for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t. I think we\u2019ve covered our tracks pretty well, but there\u2019s still a chance even at\nthis late date that somebody could come here to intercept me. No-you stay in your club and take a\nbath. Take a nice long cold bath. Got it? Don\u2019t even go out. They say it might be snowy by then\nanyway.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lurlinemas Eve! I\u2019m not going to spend the holiday in a bathtub all alone.\u201d\n\u201cWell, hire some company, see ff1 care.\u201d\n\u201cAs if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u2018just stay away from anything social, I mean theatre or crowds, or even restaurants, please, will\nyou promise me that?\u201d\n\u201cIf you could be more specific I could be more careful.\u201d\n\u201cYou could be most careful if you left town completely.\u201d\n\u201cYou could be most careful if you told me-\u201c\n\u201cGive over with that, cut it out. I don\u2019t think I even want to know where you are, come to think\nof it. Ijust want you to be safe. Will you be safe? Will you stay inside, away from drunken pagan\ncelebrations?\u201d\n\u201cCan I go to chapel and pray for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She looked so fierce that he didn\u2019t even tease her about it again.\n\u201cWhy should I keep myself so safe?\u201d he asked her, but he was almost asking himself. What is\nthere in my life worth preserving? With a good wife back there in the mountains, serviceable as an\nold spoon, dry in the heart from having been scared of marriage since she was six? With three\nchildren so shy of their father, the Prince of the Ailikis, that they will hardly come near him? With a\n\n\fcareworn clan moving here, moving there, going through the same disputes, herding the same herds,\npraying the same prayers, as they have done for five hundred years? And me, with a shallow and\nundirected mind, no artfulness in word or habit, no especial kindness toward the world? What is\nthere that makes my life worth preserving?\n\u201cI love you,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s that then, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he answered her, and himself. \u201cAnd I love you. So I promise\nto be careful.\u201d\nCareful of us both, he thought.\nSo he stalked her again. Love makes hunters of us all. She had swathed herself in long dark\nskirts, like some sort of a religious woman, and tucked up her hair inside a tall wide-brimmed hat\nwith a crown like a cone. There was a dark scarf, purple and gold, wound around her neck, and\npulled over her mouth, though she would need more than a scarf to mask that lovely prow of a nose.\nShe wore elegant, tight-fitting gloves, a nicer type of accessory than she usually went in for, though\nhe feared it was to allow for nimbler control of her hands. Her feet were lost in big, steel-toed boots\nlike the kind worn by miners in the Glikkus.\nIf you didn\u2019t know she was green, it would be hard to tell-in this dark afternoon, in this raking\nskittle of snow.\nShe didn\u2019t look behind her; perhaps she didn\u2019t care if she was being followed. Her circuit took\nher around some of the major squares of the city. She ducked in for a minute to the chapel of Saint\nGlinda next to the mauntery, the one where he had first seen her. Perhaps she was getting last-minute\ninstructions, but she didn\u2019t try to give him (or anyone else) the slip. She emerged in a minute or two.\nOr perhaps-perish the thought-she was actually praying for guidance and strength?\nShe crossed the Law Courts Bridge, she wandered along the Ozma Embankment and cut\ndiagonally through the abandoned rose gardens of the Royal Mall. The snow pestered her; she kept\ntwining her cape the more tightly around; the silhouette of her thin, dark-stockinged legs in those huge\ncomical boots showed up against the snowy blankness of the Oz Deer Park (now of course bereft of\nDeer and deer). She marched, head tucked down, past the cenotaphs and obelisks and memorial\ntablets to the Magnfficent Dead of this escapade or that. The decades-Fiyero thought, in love with\nher or at least so frightened for her that he could mistake it for love-the decades looked on and didn\u2019t\nnotice her passing. They stared from their fixed mounts across at each other and didn\u2019t see revolution\nstriding between them, on her way to destiny.\nBut the Wizard must not be her aim. She must have told the truth in saying that she was too\nuntried, and too obvious, to be selected as the Wizard\u2019s assassin. She must be involved in a\ndiversionary tactic, or in taking out a possible successor or high-level ally. For tonight the Wizard\nwould be opening the antiroyalist, revisionist Exhibit of Struggle and Virtue at the People\u2019s\nAcademy of Art and Mechanics near the Palace. Yet at the top of the Shin Road Elphaba struck out\nsideways, away from the Palace district, cutting through the small, fashionable district of Goldhaven.\nThe homes of the filthy rich were guarded by mercenaries, and she clopped past them on the\npavements, past the stableboys out sweeping the snow off the pavement with their brooms. She did\nnot look up or down or back over her shoulder. Fiyero guessed he was the more ostentatious figure,\nstriding in his opera cape in the snow a hundred paces behind.\nAt the edge of Goidhaven was perched a small bluestone jewel of a theatre, the Lady\u2019s\nMystique. In the shallow but elegant square before it, white lights and gold and green spangles hung\nin profusion, looped from streetlight to streetlight. Some holiday oratorio or other was scheduled- he\ncould only read SOLD OUT on the board in front-and the doors weren\u2019t yet opened. The crowd was\ngathering, some vendors sold hot chocolate in tall ceramic glasses, and a crowd of self-approving\nyoungsters amused themselves and bothered some elderly people by singing a parody of an old\n\n\funionist hymn of the season. The snow came down on all, on the lights, the theatre, the crowds; it\nlanded in the hot chocolate, it was churned to mush and ice on the bricks.\nBravely, foolishly-without decision or choice, it felt like-Fiyero climbed the steps of a nearby\nprivate library, to keep an eye on Elphaba, who lost herself in the crowd. Was there to be a murder\nin the theatre? Was there to be arson, the innocent sybarites roasted like chestnuts? Was it a single\nmark, an appointed victim, or was it mayhem and disaster, the more, the worse, the better?\nHe didn\u2019t know if he was there to prevent what she was about to do, or to save whomever he\ncould from the catastrophe, or to tend anyone hurt accidentally, or even maybe just to witness it, so\nhe could know more about her. And love her or not love her, but know which of the two it was.\nShe was circulating through the crowd, as if trying to locate someone. He believed, incredibly,\nthat she didn\u2019t know he was there-was she so intent on finding the right victim, and he didn\u2019t fill the\nbill? Could she not feel her lover in the same open-air square with her as the wind moved the\ncurtains of snow?\nA phalanx of Gale Forcers appeared from an alley between the theatre and a school next door.\nThey took up their places before the bank of glass doors in front. hiphaba mounted the steps of an\nancient wool market, a kind of stone gazebo. Fiyero saw that she had something under her cloak.\nExplosives? Some magic implement?\nDid she have colleagues in the square? Were they lining themselves up one with another? The\ncrowd kept getting thicker, as the hour for the oratorio drew near. Inside the glass doors, house\nmanagement was busy lining up stanchions and stringing velvet ropes to promote a genteel entry into\nthe hall. Nobody pushed and shoved into a public space like the very rich, Fiyero knew.\nA carriage came around the corner of a building on the far side of the square. It couldn\u2019t come\nright up to the doors of the theatre, as the crowds were too dense, but it proceeded as far as it was\nable. Sensing the presence of someone with authority, the crowd drew a little still. Could this be the\nelusive Wizard, on an unannounced visit? A coachman in a teck-fur headpiece flung the door open,\nand reached his hand in to assist the passenger in alighting.\nFiyero held his breath; Elphaba stiffened into petrified wood. This was the target.\nOut into the snowy street, in a tidal wave of black silk and silver spangles, swept a huge\nwoman; she was magisterial and august, she was Madame Morrible, no other; even Fiyero\nrecognized her, having met her only once.\nHe saw that Elphaba knew that this was the one she must kill; she had known this; in an instant\nall was dead clear. If she was caught and captured and tried, her motivation couldn\u2019t be more\nwonderful-she was merely a mad student from Madame Morrible\u2019s own Crage Hall, she carried a\ngrudge, she never forgot. It was too perfect.\nBut could Madame Morrible be involved in intrigue with the Wizard? Or was this just a\ndiversion, to take the mind of the authorities away from some more urgent target?\nElphaba\u2019s cape twitched; her hand went up and down inside it, as if priming something.\nMadame Morrible was growling a greeting to the crowd, which, while not necessarily knowing who\nshe was, appreciated the spectacle if not the bulk of her arrival.\nThe Head of Crage Hall walked four steps toward the theatre, on the arm of a tiktok minion, and\nElphaba leaned a little forward from under the wool market. Her chin was now sharply jutting out\nfrom the scarf, her nose aiming forward; she looked as if she could snip Madame Morrible into\nshreds, just using the serrated blades of her natural features. Her hands continued to figure out things\nbeneath the cape.\nBut then were thrown open the front doors of the building Madame Morrible was walking pastnot the theatre, but the adjacent school, Madame Teastane\u2019s Female Seminary. Out the doors\nswarmed a cluster, a little upper-class mob of schoolgirls. What were they doing in school on a\n\n\fLurlinemas Eve? Fiyero caught Elphaba looking wildly surprised. The girls were six or seven, small\ncreamy lumps of uncurdled femininity, spooned into furry muffs and tucked into furry scarves and\ntipped into boots with furry edges. They were laughing and singing, raucous and rough as the elite\nadults they would become, and in their midst was a pantomime player, someone being the Fairy\nPreenella. It was a man, as the convention had it, a man done up in silly clownlike makeup, and mock\nbouncing bosom, and a wig and extravagant skirts, and a straw hat, and a huge basket with trinkets\nand treasures spilling out. \u201cOh la, socie-tec,\u201d he fluted at Madame Morrible, \u201ceven Fairy Preenella\ncan have a present for the Lucky Pedestrian.\u201d\nFor a moment Fiyero thought the man in drag was going to pull out a knife and kill Madame\nMorrible right in front of the children. But no, espionage was organized but not that organized-this\nwas a real accident, a disruption. They hadn\u2019t figured on there being a school occasion this evening,\nnor on a screaming flock of schoolgirls greedily tugging at an actor in skirts and falsetto.\nFiyero turned back to look at Elphaba. Her face struggled with disbelief. The children were in\nthe way of whatever she was supposed to do. They were a small unruly mob, chasing around the\nHead, teasing Preenella, leaping up at him/her, grabbing for presents. The children were the\naccidental context-noisy, innocent daughters of tycoons, despots, and butcher generals.\nHe could see Elphaba working, he could see her hands fighting with each other, to do it\nanyway, to keep from doing it-whatever it was.\nMadame Momble pushed on, like a huge float in a Remembrance\nDay parade, and the doors of the theatre opened for her. She passed grandly into safety.\nOutside, the children danced and sang in the snow, the crowd surged this way and that. Elphaba\ncrumpled and sank back against a pillar, shivering with self-loathing so violently that Fiyero could\nsee it from fifty yards away. He began to push toward her, devil come what may, but by the time he\nreached the steps she had, for the first and only time, managed to lose him.\nThe audience filed into the theatre. The children shrieked their song in the street, awash with\ngreed and joy. The carriage that had brought Madame Morrible around was able to draw up in front\nof the theatre and start its long wait for her to come out again. Fiyero paused, unsure, in case there\nwas a backup plan, in case Elphaba had something else up her sleeve, in case the theatre exploded.\nThen he began to worry that, in the few minutes of losing sight of her, Elphaba had been\nrounded up by the Gale Force. Could they have whisked her out of sight that fast? What should he do\nif she became one of the disappeared?\nAt a clip, he headed back across town. Mercifully he found a waiting cab, and he had the cab\ndrive him directly to the street of warehouses adjacent to the military garrison in the city\u2019s ninth\ndistrict.\nIn a state of profound agitation he arrived back at Elphaba\u2019s little eyrie atop the corn exchange.\nAs he climbed the stairs, his bowels turned suddenly to water, and it was only with effort he\nmanaged to make it to the chamber pot. His insides slopped noisily, wetly out, and he held his\nperspiring face in his hands. The cat was perched atop the wardrobe, glaring down at him. Voided,\nwashed down, and at least loosely done up again, he tried to coax Malky with a bowl of milk. She\nwould have none of it.\nHe found a couple of dried crackers, and ate them miserably, and then pulled on the chain to\nopen the skylight, to help air the room. A couple of plops of snow fell in and sat there not melting, it\nwas that cold in the damn place. He went to build up a fire, pulled open the iron door of the stove.\nThe fire caught, then flared, and the shadows detached themselves and moved as shadows will,\nbut these shadows moved fast, across the room, at him before he could reaister what they were.\nExcent that there\nwere three, or four, or five, and they were wearing black clothes, and black char on their faces,\n\n\fand their heads were wrapped in colored scarves Like the ones he had bought for Elphaba, for\nSarima. On the shoulder of One he saw the glint of a gilded epaulet: a senior member of the Gale\nForce. There was a club and it beat down on him, like the kick of a horse, Like the falling limb of a\ntree hit by lightning. There must be pain, but he was too surprised to notice. That must be his blood,\nsquirting a ruby stain on the white cat, making it flinch. He saw its eyes open, twin golden green\nmoons, befitting of the season, and the cat then scarpered through the open skylight and was lost in\nthe snowy night.\nThe youngest maunt was obliged to answer the convent door if the bell sounded during\nmealtime. In fact she was clearing away the remains of pumpkin soup and rye brisks, the other\nmaunts already wafting, in a cerebral mood, toward their cloister chapel upstairs. She hesitated\nbefore deciding to answer the bell-in another three minutes she too would have been losing herself in\ndevotions, and the bell would have gone unheeded. She had rather get the dishes to soak, frankly. But\nthe seasonal cheer bullied her into charity.\nShe opened the huge door to find a figure crouched like a monkey in the dark corner of the stone\nporch. Beyond, snow was wrinkling the facade of the adjacent Church of Saint Glinda, making it\nlook like a reflection in water, only right way up. The streets were empty and a noise of choirs came\nfiltering out of the candle-lit church.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said the novice, remembering then to add, \u201cGood Lurlinemas, my friend.\u201d\nShe decided, once she saw the blood on the odd green wrists, and the darting look in the eyes,\nthat holiday decency required her to drag the creature inside. But she could hear her sister maunts\nassembling in their private chapel, and the mother maunt beginning to sing a prelude in her silvery\ncontralto. This was the novice\u2019s first big liturgical event as a member of this community, and she\ndidn\u2019t want to miss a moment of it.\n\u201cCome with me, dolly,\u201d she said, and the creature-a young woman a year or two older than she\nwas-managed to straighten up enough to walk, or hobble, like a cripple, like a person so\nmalnourished that their extensors cannot flex and their limbs look as if they are about to snap.\nThe novice stopped in a washroom to rinse the blood off the wrists, and to make certain that it\nwas indeed splattered mess from the beheading of some hen for a holiday supper, and not a sad\nattempt at suicide. But the stranger recoiled from the sight of water, and looked so deranged and\nunhappy that the novice stopped. She used a dry towel instead.\nThe maunts were beginning antiphonal chants upstairs! How maddening! The novice took the\npath of least resistance. She dragged the forlorn thing down toward the winter salon, where the old\nretired biddies lived out their lives in a haze of amnesia and the discreetly placed clumps of\nmarginium plants, whose sweet miasma helped mask the odors of the old and incontinent. The crones\nlived in a time of their own, they couldn\u2019t be carted upstairs to the sacred chapel anyway.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll sit you down here,\u201d she said to the woman. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you need sanctuary or\nfood or a bath or forgiveness, whatever. But you can stop here, warm and dry and safe and quiet. I\u2019ll\ncome back to you after midnight. It\u2019s the feast day, you see. It\u2019s the vigil service. Watch and wait,\nand hope.\u201d\nShe pushed the hunted, haunted woman into a soft chair, and found a blanket. Most of the crones\nwere snoring away, their heads nodding on their breastbones, dribbling softly onto bibs ornamented\nwith green and gold berries and leaves. A few were telling their beads. The courtyard, open in\nsummer, was now welled in with glass panels for the winter, so it looked like a square fish tank in\nan aquarium; snow falling in it always made them peaceful.\n\u201cLook, you can see the snow, white as the grace of the Unnamed God,\u201d said the novice,\nremembering her pastoral requirements. \u201cThink on that, and rest, and sleep. Here\u2019s a pillow. Here\u2019s\na stool for your feet. Upstairs we\u2019ll be singing and praising the Unnamed God. I\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d said the green ghostly guest, then slumped her head against the pillow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to,\u201d said the novice, a bit aggressively, and fled, just in time to catch the\nprocessional hymn.\nFor a while the winter salon was still. It was like a fishbowl into which a new acquisition has\nbeen dropped. The snow moved as if done by a machine, gently and mesmerizingly, with a soft churr.\nThe blossoms of the mareinium plants closed a bit in the strengthening cold of the room. Oil lamps\nissued their funereal crepe ribbons into the air. On the other side of the garden-hardly visible through\nthe snow and the two windows-a decrepit haunt, with a more precise grasp of the calendar than her\nsisters, began to hum a saucy old pagan hymn to Lurline.\nUp to the shivering figure of the newcomer came one of the elders, inching forward in a\nwheeled chair. She leaned forward and sniffed. From a cloak of plaid blanket, blue and ivory, she\npawed her old hands along the armrests. She reached out and touched Elphaba\u2019s hand.\n\u201cWell, the poor dolly is sick, the poor dolly is tired,\u201d said the ancient thing. Her hands felt, as\nthe novice\u2019s had done, for open wounds on the wrists. Nothing. \u201cThough intact, the poor dolly is in\npain,\u201d she said, as if approving. A dome of near-balding scalp came into view under the hood of the\nblanket. \u201cThe poor dolly is faint, the poor dolly is faltering,\u201d she went on. She rocked a bit and\npressed Elphaba\u2019s hands between her own, as if to warm them, but it was doubtful that her anemic\nand incompetent old circulatory system could heat a stranger when it could scarcely heat herself.\nStill she kept on. \u201cThe poor poppet is failure itself,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHappy holidays to one and all.\nCome my dear, lay your breast on old Mother\u2019s bosom. Old Mother Maunt will set things right.\u201d She\ncouldn\u2019t quite pull Elphaba out of her position of dreamless, sleepless grief. She could only keep\nElphaba\u2019s hands tightly clutched within her own, as a sepal sockets the furls of young petal. \u201cCome,\nmy precious and all will be well. Rest in the bosom of mad Mother Yackle. Mother Yackle will see\nyou home.\u201d\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\n\n\fBook 4 - In the Vinkus\nOn the day the seven-year maunt was to leave, Sister Bursar took the huge iron key from her\nbosom and unlocked the store chamber, and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d She pulled from the press three black\nshifts, six camisoles, gloves, and a shawl. She also handed over the broom. Finally, for emergencies,\na basket of simples-herbs and roots, tinctures, rues, salves and balms.\nThere was paper, too, though not much: a dozen pages or so, in different shapes and\nthicknesses. Paper was in ever shorter supply in all of Oz. \u201cMake it last, make it important,\u201d advised\nSister Bursar. \u201cYou\u2019re a bright one, for all your sulks and silences.\u201d She found a pen. A pfenix\nfeather, known for the endurance and strength of the quill. Three pots of black ink, sealed under\nknobby wristholds of wax.\nOatsie Manglehand was waiting in the ambulatory with the old Superior Maunt. The convent\nwas paying a decent penny for this service, and Oatsie needed the fees. But she didn\u2019t like the look\nof the sullen maunt that Sister Bursar ushered in. \u201cThis is your passenger,\u201d said the Superior Maunt.\n\u201cHer name is Sister Saint Aelphaba. She\u2019s spent many years in solitary life and in nursing. The habit\nof gossip is lost. But it\u2019s time for her to move on, and move on she will. You\u2019ll find her no trouble.\u201d\nOatsie looked the passenger over and said, \u201cThe Grasstrail Train doesn\u2019t promise the survival\nof its party, Mother. I\u2019ve led two dozen trips these past ten years or so, and there have been more\ncasualties than I like to admit.\u201d\n\u201cShe leaves of her own free will,\u201d said the Superior Maunt. \u201cShould she wish to return at any\npoint, we would take her in. She is one of us.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t look one of anything to Oatsie, neither flesh nor fowl,\nneither idiot nor intellectual. Sister Saint Aelphaba just stared at the floor. Though she seemed\nto be about thirty, she had a sallow, adolescent look about her.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the luggage-you can manage it?\u201d The Superior Maunt pointed to the small heap of\nsupplies in the immaculate forecourt in front of the mauntery. Then she turned to the departing maunt.\n\u201cSweet child of the Unnamed God,\u201d said the Superior Maunt, \u201cyou go from us to conduct an exercise\nin expiation. You feel there is a penalty to pay before you may find peace. The unquestioning silence\nof the cloister is no longer what you need. You are returning to yourselfi So we send you from us\nwith our love and with our expectations of your success. Godspeed, my good sister.\u201d\nThe passenger kept her eyes trained on the ground and did not answer.\nThe Superior Maunt sighed. \u201cWe must be off to our devotions.\u201d She peeled a few notes from a\nroll of money kept in the recesses of her veils, and handed them over to Oatsie Manglehand. \u201cThis\nshould see you through, and more besides.\u201d\nIt was a healthy amount. Oatsie stood to earn a lot from escorting this taciturn woman through\nthe Kells-more than from the whole rest of her party combined. \u201cYou are too good, Mother Maunt,\u201d\nshe said. She took the cash with her strong hand, and made a gesture of deference with her limp one.\n\u201cNo one is too good,\u201d said the Superior Maunt, but nicely, and retired with surprising speed\nbehind the cloister doors. Sister Bursar said, \u201cYou\u2019re on your own now, Sister Elphie, and may all\nthe stars smile you on your way!\u201d and she disappeared as well. Oatsie went to load the luggage and\nsupplies in the wagon. There was a small, chunky ragamuffin boy asleep behind the trunk. \u201cOff with\nyou,\u201d said Oatsie, but the boy muttered, \u201cI\u2019m to go too, that\u2019s what they told me.\u201d Vv\u2019hen Sister Saint\nAelphaba neither confirmed nor denied this plan, Oatsie began to understand why the payment to take\nthe green maunt away had been more than generous.\nThe Cloister of Saint Glinda was located in the Shale Shallows, twelve miles southwest of the\nEmerald City. It was an outpost mauntery, under\n\n\fthe aegis of the one in town. Sister Saint Aelphaba had spent two years in town and five years\nhere, according to the Mother Maunt. \u201cYou want to be called Sister still, now that you\u2019re sprung\nfrom that holy prison?\u201d asked Oatsie as she clucked the reins and urged the packhorses on.\n\u201cElphie is fine,\u201d said the passenger.\n\u201cAnd the boy, what\u2019s he called?\u201d\nElphie shrugged.\nThe coach met the rest of the caravan a few miles on. There were four wagons in all, and fifteen\ntravelers. Elphie and the boy were the last to join. Oatsie Manglehand outlined the proposed route:\nsouth along the edge of Kellswater, west through Kumbricia\u2019s Pass, northwest through the Thousand\nYear Grasslands, stopping at Kiamo Ko, and then wintering a bit farther northwest. The Vinkus was\nuncivilized land, Oatsie told them, and there were tribal groups to be wary of: the Yunamata, the\nScrow, the Arjiki. And there were animals. And spirits. They would need to stick together. They\nwould need to trust one another.\nElphie showed no sign of listening. She fiddled with the pfenix feather and drew patterns in the\nsoil between her feet, coiling shapes like dragons writhing or smoke rising. The boy squatted eight\nor ten feet away, wary and shuttered. He seemed to be her page, for he managed her bags and\nattended her needs, but they did not look at each other, or speak. Oatsie found it strange in the\nextreme, and hoped it didn\u2019t augur ill.\nThe Grasstrail Train set off at sunset, and made only a few miles before its first camp at a\nstreambed. The party-mostly Gillikinese- chattered in nervous amazement at their courage, to go so\nfar afield from the safety of central Oz! All for different reasons: for business, for family needs, to\npay a debt, to kill an enemy. The Vinkus was a frontier, and the Winkies a beknighted, bloodthirsty\nfolk who knew little about indoor plumbing or the rules of etiquette so the party regaled itself in\nsong. Oatsie took part for a short time, but she knew there was hardly one among them who wouldn\u2019t\nprefer to stay where they were and avoid the depths of the Vinkus altogether. Except perhaps that\nElphie, who was keeping pretty much to herself.\nThey left the rich edge of Gillikin behind. The Virikus began with a mesh of pebbles spread on\nbrown wet soil. At night the Lizard Star pointed the\ndirection: south, south along the edge of the Great Kells, to the dangerous gap of Kumbricia\u2019s\nPass. Pines and black starsaps stood up like teeth on every embankment. By day they were\nwelcoming, sometimes giving shade. By night they towered, and harbored snatchowls and bats.\nElphie was often awake at night. Thought was returning to her, perhaps expanding under the\nfierce openness, where the birds cried in falling voices, and the meteors stitched omens into the sky.\nSometimes she tried to write with her pfeni.x feather; sometimes she sat and thought words out, and\ndidn\u2019t commit them to paper.\nLife outside the cloister seemed to cloud up with such particularity-the shape of her seven years\npast was already being crowded out. All that undifferentiated time, washing terra-cotta floors\nwithout dipping her hands in the bucket-it took hours to do a single room, but no floor was ever\ncleaner. Making wine, taking in the sick, working in the infirmary wing, which had reminded her\nbriefly of Crage Hall. The benefit of a uniform was that one need not struggle to be unique-how many\nuniquenesses could the Unnamed God or nature create? One could sink selflessly into the daily\npattern, one could find one\u2019s way without groping. The little changes-the red bird landing on the\nwindowsill, and that was spring-the leaves to rake from the terrace, and that was fall-they were\nenough. Three years of absolute silence, two years of whisper, and then, moved up (and outward) by\nthe decision of the Superior Maunt, two years on the ward for incurables.\nThere, for nine months-thought Elphie under the stars, picturing it to herself as if telling\nsomeone else-she tended the dying, and those too clumsy to die. She grew to see dying as a pattern,\n\n\fbeautiful in its way. A human form is like a leaf, it dies in a set piece unless something interferes:\nfirst this, then that, then this. She might have gone on as a nurse forever, arranging wrists in a\npleasing pattern above starched bedsheets, reading the nonsense words of scripture that seemed to\nhelp so. She could manage the dying.\nThen, a year ago, pale invalid Tibbett was carted to the Home for the Incurables. He wasn\u2019t too\nfar gone to recognize her even behind her veil and silences. Weak, unable to shit or piss without\nhelp, his skin falling in rags and parchment, he was better at life than she was. He selfishly required\nthat she be an individual, and he addressed her by her\nname. He joked, he remembered stories, he criticized old friends for abandoning him, he\nnoticed the differences in how she moved from day to day, how she thought. He reminded her that\nshe did think. Under the scrutiny of his tired frame she was re-created, against her will, as an\nindividual. Or nearly.\nAt last he died, and the Superior Maunt had said that it was time for her to go and atone for her\nmistakes, though not even the Superior Maunt knew what they were. \u2018When that was done?-well, she\nwas still a young woman, she could raise a family. Take her broom and remember:\nobedience and mystery.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Oatsie one night as Elphie sat under the stars.\nBut though her thoughts were rich and complicated, her words were poor, and she merely\ngrunted. Oatsie made a few jokes at which Elphie tried to smile, but Oatsie laughed enough for both\nof them. Big, full laughs. It made Elphie tired.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that cook a piece of work?\u201d said Oatsie, and told some episode that seemed pointless,\nand she chortled at her own story. Elphie tried to enjoy, tried to grin, but above her the stars grew\nthicker, more like glittering fishspawn than salt; they turned on their stalks with a cursing, grinding\nsound, if only she could hear it. She couldn\u2019t hear it; Oatsie was too coarse and loud.\nThere was much to hate in this world, and too much to love.\nBefore long they came to the edge of Kellswater, a murderous slice of water lying as if cleft\nfrom the side of a thundercloud. It was all gray, no lights on it. \u201cThat,\u201d said Oatsie, \u201cis why the\nhorses don\u2019t drink from it, nor travelers; that\u2019s why it was never tapped in aqueducts and run to the\nEmerald City. It\u2019s dead water. And you thought you\u2019d seen it all.\u201d Still, the travelers were\nimpressed. A lavender heaviness arose on its western edge-the first hint of the Great Kells, the\nmountains that separated the Vinkus from the rest of Oz. From here the mountains appeared as thin as\ngas.\nOatsie demonstrated the use of the fog charm in the event of an attack by a band of Yunamata\nhunters. \u201cAre we going to be attacked?\u201d asked the boy who seemed to be Elphie\u2019s page. \u201cI\u2019ll get \u2018em\ndead before no one knows what\u2019s on.\u201d The fear rose up from him and caught on in\nthe others. \u201cWe usually do well,\u201d said Oatsie, \u201cwe just need to be prepared. They can be\nfriends. If we are friends.\u201d\nThe caravan straggled by day, four wagons keeping their distance, accompanied by nine horses,\ntwo cows, a bull, a heifer, and various chickens without much personality. The cook had a dog\nnamed Killyjoy who seemed to Elphie a Makejoy instead, a panting, sniffy thing. Some people\nthought for a time he might actually be a Dog, in hiding, but they gave up that idea. \u201cHah,\u201d Elphie\nsaid to the others, \u201chave you spoken to Animals so seldom that you can\u2019t remember the difference\nanymore?\u201d No, he was just a dog, but a most glorious doggy dog, full of rages and exaggerated\ndevotions. Killyjoy was a mountain breed, part Linster collie, part Lenx terrier, and maybe part\nwolf. His nose went up like a butter curl, in gray-black ridges and ribs. He could not be kept from\nhunting but he did not catch much either. By night, when the wagons squared off together, the cooking\nfire within, the animals just nearby, without, and the singing began at last, Killyjoy hid under the\n\n\fwagon.\nOatsie heard the boy tell the dog his name. \u201cI\u2019m Liir,\u201d said the boy.\n\u201cYou can be my dog, sort of.\u201d She had to smile. The fat child was not good at making friends,\nand a lonely child should have a dog.\nKdlswater slipped back, out of sight. Some felt safer away from it. Almost hourly the Great\nKells rose and thickened, the color now like the brown rind of a butterdew melon. Still the track\nmeandered along the valley, the Vinkus River on its right, the mountains beyond it. Oatsie knew\nseveral places to ford, but they weren\u2019t clearly marked. \u2018While they searched, Killyjoy caught a\nvalley grite at last. He bled and whined, and was treated for poison. Liir let him ride in his arms,\nwhich made Elphie faintly jealous. She was almost amused to note in herself such a turgid, oldfashioned feeling as jealousy.\nThe cook was angry that Killyjoy preferred someone else\u2019s company more than his-he shook his\nladle overhead as if summoning the wrath of angel chefs among the stars. Elphie thought of him as a\nbutcher cook, as he seemed to have no scruples about shooting rabbits and eating them. \u201cHow do you\nknow they\u2019re not Rabbits?\u201d she said, and she wouldn\u2019t touch a bite.\n\u201cQuiet, you, or I\u2019ll cook that little boy instead,\u201d he answered.\nShe tried to raise with Oatsie the notion of firing the cook, but Oatsie would not listen. \u201cWe\u2019re\ncoming in to Kumbricia\u2019s Pass,\u201d she said, \u201cmy mind is on other matters.\u201d\nThey couldn\u2019t help but feel the unsettling eroticism of the landscape. From the eastern approach,\nthe Kumbricia Pass looked like a woman lying on her back, her legs spread apart, welcoming them.\nUp in the slopes, the pine boughs shaded the sun, the wild pears tangled their twisted branches\ntogether as if wrestling. A sudden dampness, a new private climate-the bark ran wet, the air sank\nheavily against the skin like half-laundered toweling. Once inside the forest, the travelers could not\nsee the hills. Everything smelled of ferns and fiddle-greens. And on the shores of a small lake stood\na dead tree. It harbored a community of bees, at their work of chamber music and honey.\n\u201cI want to take them with us,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to them and see if they\u2019ll come.\u201d\nThere had been bees in the kitchen garden at Crage Hall, and again at the Cloister of Saint\nGlinda in the Shale Shallows. Elphie was entranced by them. But Liir was terrified, and the cook\nthreatened to disappear and leave the group traumatized by an inability to do a really topnotch\nbechamel sauce in the wilderness. Discussion was waged. An old man in the party, heading\nwestward to die because of some midnight vision, ventured as to how a little honey would improve\nthe tasteless sparrowleaf tea. A Glikkun mail-order bride agreed. Oatsie, of sentimental enthusiasms\nwhen least expected, voted for honey. So Elphie climbed the tree and talked to the bees, and they\ncame along in a swarm, but most travelers stayed in the other wagons, suddenly scared of every fleck\nof dust that flitted against the skin.\nThey sent out a request, using drums and mist, to attract the attention of a hired rafiqi, for\ncaravans were not allowed to move through the lands of different Vinkus tribes without a guide to\nnegotiate permissions and fees. Bored one evening, and responding to the gloom, the travelers fell to\ndiscussing the legend of the Kumbric Witch. Who comes first, the Fairy Queen Lurline or the\nKumbric Witch?\nIgo, the sick old man, quoted the Oziad, and reminded them all of how creation worked: the\nDragon of Time created the sun and the moon,\nand Lurline cursed them and said that their children wouldn\u2019t know their own parents, and then\nthe Kumbric Witch came along and the flood, the battle, the spilling of evil in the world.\nOatsie Manglehand disagreed. She said, \u201cYou old fools, the Oziad is just a frilly, romantic\npoem of older, harsher legends. What lives in folk memory is truer than how some artsy poet says it.\nIn folk memory evil always predates good.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cCan this be true?\u201d asked Igo, with interest.\n\u201cSurely there is the handful of nursery marchen that start, \u2018Once in the middle of a forest lived\nan old witch\u2019 or \u2018The devil was out walking one day and met a child,\u201d said Oatsie, who was\nshowing that she had some education as well as grit. \u201cTo the grim poor there need be no pour quoi\ntale about where evil arises; it just arises; it always is. One never learns how the witch became\nwicked, or whether that was the right choice for her-is it ever the right choice? Does the devil ever\nstruggle to be good again, or if so is he not a devil? It is at the very least a question of definitions.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly is true that tales of the Kumbric Witch abound,\u201d agreed Igo. \u201cEvery other witch is\njust a shadow, a daughter, a sister, a decadent descendant; the Kumbric Witch is the model further\nback than which it seems impossible to go.\u201d\nElphie remembered the ambiguous scroll painting of the Kumbric Witch-was it she?-found in\nthe library of Three Queens, that summer long ago: standing in shiny shoes, straddling a continent,\nnursing or choking a beast.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the Kumbric Witch, even in Kumbricia\u2019s Pass,\u201d boasted the cook.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in Rabbits either,\u201d snarled Elphie, suddenly annoyed. \u201cThe question is,\ndoes the Kumbric Witch believe in you?\u201d\n\u201cTemper,\u201d sang out Oatsie, and turned it into a singalong song. Elphie stamped away. This was\ntoo much like her childhood, discussions with her father and Nessarose about where evil begins. As\nif one could ever know! Her father used to orchestrate proofs about evil as a way of persuading his\nflock to convert. Elphie had come to think, back in Shiz, that as women wore cologne, men wore\nproofs: to secure their own sense of themselves, and thus to be attractive. But surely evil was beyond\nproof, just as the Kumbric Witch was beyond the grasp of knowable history?\nThe rafiqi arrived, a thin, balding man with battle scars. There might be trouble from the\nYunamata this year, he told them. \u201cThe caravan comes after a season of dirty forays by cavalry from\nthe Emerald City. Winkie roundup,\u201d he complained. It wasn\u2019t clear if he was talking about a local\nargument over a drunken slight to a Vinkus maiden or about a slave trade and resettlement camps.\nThe camp was broken, the lake left behind, and the silent forest continued for a half a day.\nSunlight speared through the canopy from time to time, but it was a thin, egg yolk light, and seemed\nalways to be off to the side, never spotlighting down on the path ahead. It was eerie, as if Kumbricia\nherself were moving along beside them, hidden, unbidden, passing from tree to tree, sliding behind\nrocks, waiting in shadowy depths, watching and listening. The ailing old man wailed nasally, and\nprayed to emerge from this mystery wood before he died, or his spirit might never find its way out.\nThe boy wept like a girl. The cook wrung the neck of a chicken.\nEven the bees stopped humming.\nIn the middle of the night the cook disappeared. There was consternation among all except\nElphie, who didn\u2019t care. Was it a kidnapping, or a sleepwalking episode, or a suicide? Were the\nangry Yunamata near, and watching? Was it Kumbricia herself taking revenge on them for discussing\nher so glibly? There were many opinions, and the breakfast eggs were runny and inedible.\nKillyjoy did not notice the cook\u2019s disappearance. He snuggled, grinning in his coma-sleep,\ncloser to Liir.\nThe bees went into some sort of mysterious hibernation inside the joint of tree trunk brought\nalong to make them happy. Killyjoy, still smarting from grite poison, slept twenty-two hours a day.\nThe travelers, afraid of being overheard, stopped talking altogether.\nToward the evening the pines at last began to thin, and the forest to shift to stag-head oak, which\nwith its broader branches let in more of the sky-a pasty yellow sky, but at last a sky-and then there\nwas a cliff edge. They had climbed higher than anyone had quite realized; beneath and\nbeyond stretched the rest of Kumbricia\u2019s Pass, a journey of four or five days. Beyond that was\n\n\fthe beginning of the Thousand Year Grasslands.\nNo one was sorry for the light and room that the sky afforded. Even Elphie felt her heart lift,\nunexpectedly.\nIn the middle of the night the Yunamata arrived. They brought gifts of dried fruit and sang tribal\nsongs, and made those who would dance get up and dance. The travelers were more terrified of their\nhospitality than of the attack that they had expected.\nAs Elphie thought about it, the Yunamata seemed soft, compliant folk, only as fearful and\nfearless as schoolgirls-at least that was all they showed. They were cavorting, opinionated; they\nreminded her of the Quadlings with whom she had grown up. Perhaps ethnically they were distant\ncousins. Long lashes. Narrow elbows. Babylike supple wrists. Oblong heads and thin concentrated\nlips-even with their foreign tongue they made her feel at home.\nThe Yunamata left in the morning, complaining rudely about the runniness of the breakfast eggs.\nThe rafiqi said that the Yunamata would make no further trouble. Even he seemed disappointed, as if\nhis employment hadn\u2019t been required.\nThere was no word about the cook. The Yunamata didn\u2019t seem to know anything about him.\nAs the caravan continued its descent, the sky opened up again, brisk and autumnal, wide as\nremorse. From thcrc to thcrc!-the eye could hardly take it in. The plain below, compared to the\nmountains, seemed level as a lake. The wind made strokes across it, as if spelling things in a\nlanguage of curls and stripes. No wildlife was visible from this distance, though there were tribal\nfires here and there. Kumbricia\u2019s Pass was left behind, or nearly.\nThen a Yunamata messenger came on swift leathery feet, arriving from the Pass behind them, to\nshare the news that a body had been found at the base of a cliff. Perhaps it was the cook; it was\nthought to be a man, but the surface of the corpse was so swollen with lesions that the particulars\nwere lost. \u201cIt was the bees,\u201d said someone, full of rage.\n\u201cOh, was it?\u201d came Elphie\u2019s calm voice. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asleep for so long. Wouldn\u2019t there\nhave been screams if they\u2019d attacked a man in the\nmiddle of the night? Did the bees sting his throat first, to swell his vocal cords shut? Very\ntalented bees, those.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the bees,\u201d was the mutter, and the implication was clear. You too.\n\u201cOh, I forgot the size of the human imagination,\u201d Elphie said meanly. \u201cHow very large it is,\nafter all.\u201d\nBut she wasn\u2019t upset, not really. For Killyjoy was back to himself, at last, and the bees woke up\ntoo. Perhaps the high altitudes at the top of the Kumbricia Pass had given them such sleep. Elphie\nbegan to prefer their company to the rest of the travelers. As they woke up, coming down from the\nheights, she felt herself more and more awake, too.\nThe rafiqi pointed out on the horizon several mounding coils of smoke. At first the travelers\nguessed they were windstorms, but Oatsie soothed them and alarmed them: It was evening fires for a\nlarge encampment. S crow. It was autumn hunting season, though nothing had been seen of any game\nbigger than a hare or a grass fox (its brush a wild swipe of bronze on melting golden meadow, its\nfeet in black stockings like a serving maid\u2019s). Killyjoy was ecstatic with the possibilities of\nencounter; he could hardly bear to rest at night. Even in his dreams he twitched with the hunt.\nThe travelers feared the Scrow more than they had the Yunamata. The rafiqi did not say much to\nallay their fears. He was more tentative than it had first seemed; perhaps the job of negotiating\namong suspicious peoples required caution. Liir idolized him hopelessly, after only a few days of\ntravel. Elphie thought: Such silly things, children-and so embarrassing-because they keep changing\nthemselves out of shame, out of a need to be loved or something. While animals are born who they\nare, accept it, and that is that. They live with greater peace than people do.\n\n\fShe felt in herself a jolt of pleasurable expectation over the thought of approaching the Scrow.\nAlong with so much else, she had forgotten what pleasurable expectation was. As night fell,\neveryone seemed more alert, out of fear and excitement. The skies throbbed with turquoise, even at\nmidnight. Starlight and comet tails burned the tips of endless grass below into a hammered silver.\nLike thousands of tapers in the chapel, just blown out but still glowing.\nIf one could drown in the grass, thought Elphie, it might be the best way to die.\nIt was noon when the caravan pulled up to the edge of the Scrow camp. A committee of Scrow\nhad ridden to their domestic margin, where the sand-colored tents petered out into untrampled grassmen and women alike sat on horseback, about seven or eight of them, in blue ribbons and ivory\nbangles. Also, obviously senior, was a huge slab of an old woman carried in a palanquin of some\nsort, its frame all hung round with tambours and clinking amulets and gauzy veils. She let the rafiqi\nand the tribal paladins trade compliments or insults. After a while she grunted a direction and her\ncurtains were withdrawn so she could see. She had an overhung lip, so large that it doubled back on\nitself like an upside-down spout on a pitcher. Her eyes were ringed with kohl. On her shoulders sat\ntwo dyspeptic-looking crows. Their feet were shackled in gold links and attached to loops in her\nornamental collar, into which the old woman had dribbled traces of the fruit she had been eating as\nshe waited. Her shoulders were speckled with crow droppings.\n\u201cThe Princess Nastoya,\u201d said the rafiqi at last.\nShe was the filthiest, least-educated princess anyone had ever seen, yet she had some dignity;\neven the most ardent democrat among the travelers genuflected. She laughed raucously. Then she\nbade her bearers lug her away to someplace less tedious.\nThe Scrow camp was arranged in concentric circles, with the Princess\u2019s tent in the middle,\nprettied up with extensions of faded striped baldaquins on all sides. It was a little airy palace in\nsilks and cotton muslin. Her advisors and concubine-husbands seemed to live in the nearest circle\n(and a scrawny lot the husbands were, thought Elphie, but perhaps they were chosen for timidity and\nscrawniness, to make her seem ever the larger). Beyond the Princess\u2019s settlement ranged four\nhundred tents, which meant maybe a thousand people altogether. A thousand humans, with their\npoached-salmon skin, their moistly protruding eyes (but sensitive, in lowered gazes, to avoid being\nmet), their handsome generous noses, and big buttocks, and wide rolling hips, men and women alike.\nMost of the caravan travelers stayed glued to the doors of their wag. ons, imagining crime just\nbeyond the nearest tent. But Elphie found it impossible to keep still, with all this newness beckoning.\nWhen Elphie walked, there were gasps, and the adults shyly retreated out of her path. But only ten\nminutes had passed before there were sixty children in a noisy crowd, following behind, running\nahead, like a cloud of midges.\nThe rafiqi advised caution, advised return to the camp; but childhood in the Quadling badlands\nhad made Elphaba not only bold, but curious. There were more ways to live than the ones given by\none\u2019s superiors.\nAfter the evening meal, a delegation of erect old Scrow dignitaries approached the Grasstrail\nTrain and entered into a lengthy palaver with the rafiqi. In the end, the rafiqi translated the message:\na small band was invited-requested-(ordered?)-to the Scrow shrine. It would take an hour by camel.\nFor her sin of skin color, presumably, or possibly for having had the nerve to take a solitary stroll\nthrough the Scrow tent city, Elphie was told to join Oatsie, the rafiqi, Igo for his venerable age, and\none of the financial adventurers-named Pinchweed, or maybe that was just a nasty nickname.\nBy the light of sallowwood torches, the camels, in glittering caparisons, lurched and lumbered\non a worn track. It was like going up and down a staircase at the same time. Elphie sat above the\ngrass, a vantage point over the great ffickering surface. Although the ocean was only an idea sprung\nout of mythology, she could almost see where it came from-there were small grasshawks launching\n\n\fthemselves like fish leaping out of the spume, nipping at the fireflies, pocketing them, then falling\nback in a dry splash. Bats passed, making a guttering, sputtering sound that ended in an extinguishing\nswoop. The plain itself seemed to bring forth night color: now a heliotrope, now a bronzy green,\nnow a dun color skeined through with red and silver. The moon rose, an opalescent goddess tipping\nlight from her harsh maternal scimitar. Nothing more need have happened; it seemed enough to\nElphaba to find herself capable of such a weird ecstatic response to soft color and safe space. But\nno, on-on.\nEventually Elphie noticed a plantation of trees, carefully tended in this devastating openness.\nFirst a stand of scrub spruce, contorted by the winds into gnarled figures of split bark and hissing\nneedles-and the pagan odor of sap. Beyond, a rise of higher hedges, then, yet higher trees.\nIt was the circular pattern of the Scrow encampment again. The party passed into it in silence,\nas through a maze, along curving corridors of whispering brush, moving from outer to inner circles\nlit by oil lamps hammered to carven posts.\nWithin, at the center, was the Princess Nastoya girded in a native costume of leather and grass\nmade all the more effective by a length of striped purple and white toweling she must have bargained\nfrom some traveler or other. She stood, distracted and breathing heavily, leaning on stout walking\nsticks; around her, sarsen stones like gapped teeth resembled a stone cage through which she could\nhardly pass, given her bulk.\nThe guests joined the hosts in eating, drinking, and smoking on a pipe with a bowl carved like a\ncrow\u2019s head. Crows ranged all around on the tops of the sarsens, twenty, thirty, forty? Elphie\u2019s head\nspun, the moon rose, the plain at night, invisible from the secret garden of the green maze, wheeled\nabout like a child\u2019s top. She could almost hear the spinning. The Scrow elders chanted in a drone.\nWhen the drone died out, the Princess Nastoya raised her head.\nThe huge wattles of old flesh beneath her small chin wobbled. Her toweling fell to the ground.\nShe was naked and old and strong; what had seemed like boredom was revealed as patience,\nmemory, control. She shook the very hair off her head and it uncoiled down her back and\ndisappeared. Her feet moved massively, as if seeking the best purchase, like columns, like pillars of\nstone. She dropped her arms forward and her back was a dome; still her head was up, her eyes the\nbrighter, her nose working mightily; she was an Elephant.\nAn Elephant goddess, Elphie thought, her mind recoiling in terror and delight, but the Princess\nNastoya said, \u201cNo.\u201d She spoke through the rafiqi still; he had obviously seen this before, though with\nthe alcohol he stuttered and had to search for words.\nOne by one she asked the intentions of the travelers.\n\u201cMoney and commerce,\u201d said Pinchweed, shocked into honesty:\nmoney and commerce and pillage and plunder at whatever cost.\n\u201cA place to die where I can rest, and my spirit go abroad,\u201d ventured Igo.\n\u201cSafety and movement, out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Oatsie spunkily, by which it was clear she\nmeant: out of men\u2019s way.\nThe rafiqi indicated that Elphie\u2019s own answer was still needed.\nIn the presence of such an Animal, Elphie could not stay aloof. So she spoke it as best as she\ncould. \u201cTo retire from the world after making sure of the safety of the survivors of my lover. To face\nhis widow, Sarima, in guilt and responsibility, and then to remove myself from the darkening\nworld.\u201d\nThe Elephant told the others, except the rafiqi, to leave.\nThe Elephant raised her trunk and sniffed the wind. Her rheumy old eyes blinked slowly and her\nears moved back and forth, raking the air for nuance. She pissed hugely in a steaming flow, with\ndignity and nonchalance, eyes firmly latched on Elphaba.\n\n\fThrough the rafiqi, the Elephant then said, \u201cDaughter of the dragon, I too am under a spell. I\nknow how it may be broken-but I choose to live as a changeling. An Elephant is a hunted thing in\nthese times. The Scrow approve of me. They have worshipped elephants from the time before\nlanguage, the time before history began. They know I am not a goddess. They know I am a beast who\nchooses magical incarceration as a human over the dangerous liberty of my own powerful form.\n\u201cWhen the times are a crucible, when the air is full of crisis,\u201d she said, \u201cthose who are the most\nthemselves are the victims.\u201d\nElphie could only look, she could not speak.\n\u201cBut the choice to save yourself can itself be deadly,\u201d said the Princess Nastoya.\nElphie nodded, looked away, looked back.\n\u201cI will give you three crows as your familiars,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cYou are in hiding as a witch\nnow. That is your guise.\u201d She spoke a word to the crows, and three mangy, evil-looking things came\nand waited nearby.\n\u201cA witch?\u201d Elphaba said. What her father would think! \u201cHiding from what?\u201d\n\u201cWe have the same enemy,\u201d replied the Princess. \u201cWe are both at risk. If you need help send the\ncrows. If I am still alive, as an old matriarch monarch, or as a free Elephant, I\u2019ll come to your aid.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Elphie.\n\u201cBecause no retreat from the world can mask what is in your face,\u201d she answered.\nThe Princess said more. It had been years-more than a decade- since Elphie had been able to\ntalk to an Animal. Who, Elphie asked the Princess, had enchanted her? But the Princess Nastoya\nwouldn\u2019t say-in part as self-protection, for the death of the enchanter could sometimes mean the\nrevocation of binding spells, and her curse was her safety.\n\u201cBut is life worth living in the wrong form?\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cThe interior doesn\u2019t change,\u201d she answered, \u201cexcept by selfinvolvement. Of which be not\nafraid, and also beware.\u201d\n\u201cI have no interior,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cSomething told those bees to kill the cook,\u201d said the Princess Nastoya, with a glitter in her eye.\nElphaba felt herself go pale.\n\u201cI didii\u2019t!\u201d she said. \u201cNo, it couldn\u2019t have been me! And how did you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou did, on some level. You are a strong woman. And I can hear bees, you know. My ears are\nkeen.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to stay here with you,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cLife has been very hard. If you can hear me\nwhen I cannot hear myself-something the Superior Maunt could never do-you could help me do no\nharm in this world. That\u2019s all I want-to do no harm.\u201d\n\u201cBy your own admission, you have a job to do,\u201d said the Princess. She curled her trunk around\nElphaba\u2019s face, feeling its contours and truths. \u201cGo and do it.\u201d\n\u201cMay I return to you?\u201d asked Elphie.\nBut the Princess wouldn\u2019t answer. She was tiring-she was an old old thing even for an\nElephant. Her trunk went back and forth like a pendulum on a clock. Then the great nose-hand came\nforward and set itself with wonderful weight and precision on Elphaba\u2019s shoulders, and curled a bit\naround her neck. \u201cListen to me, sister,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember this:\nNothing is written in the stars. Not these stars, nor any others. No one controls your destiny.\u201d\nElphaba could not answer, so shocked was she at the touch. She backed away when dismissed,\nher mind all but out of her.\nThen the return on camels across the shuddering colors of night grass: hypnotic, vague, and\ndistressing.\nYet there was blessing in this night. Elphaba had forgotten blessing, too-like so much else.\n\n\fThey left the Scrow encampment and the Princess Nastoya behind. The Grasstrail Train moved\nin a circle north, now, a wide arch.\nIgo died, and was buried in a sandy mound. \u201cGive his spirit movement and flight,\u201d said Elphie\nat the ceremony.\nThe rafiqi admitted later that he had thought one of the guests of the command meeting with the\nPrincess Nastoya was to be sacrfficed in a ritual slaughter. It had happened before. The Princess,\nthough coping with her dilemma, was not above a sense of revenge. It was the honesty of Pinchweed\nthat saved him, as he was the obvious choice. Or perhaps Igo wore the prospect of his death closer\nto the surface than humans could see, and the Elephant took pity.\nThe crows were annoying; they pestered the bees, shat all over the wagon, teased Killyjoy. The\nGlikkun, Raraynee, stopped at a well, met her isolated widower husband-to-be, and left the\nGrasstrail Train. The toothless new husband already had six motherless children, and they took to\nRaraynee like orphaned ducklings behind a farm dog. There were only ten travelers left.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re entering Atjiki tribal lands,\u201d said the rafiqi.\nThe first Arjiki band approached a few days later. They wore nothing so splendid as what\nFiyero had worn, in the way of blue markings-these were nomads, shepherds, rounding up the sheep\nfrom the western foothills of the Great Kells for their annual counting and, it seemed, sale to the\nEast. Still, just the handsome look of them ripped Elphie\u2019s heart into pieces. Their wildness. Their\notherness. This may be a punishment to the hour of my death, she thought.\nThe Grasstrail Train by now was down to only two wagons: in one, the rafiqi, Oatsie, Liir the\nboy, Pinchweed the entrepreneur, and a Gillikinese mechanic named Kowpp. In the other, Elphie\nherself, and the bees, the crows, and Killyjoy. Already she had, it seemed, been accepted as a witch.\nIt was not an entirely unlikable disguise.\nKiamo Ko was just a week away.\nThe Grasstrail Train turned eastward, into the steel gray passes of the steep Great Kells. Winter\nwas almost here, and the last travelers were grateful that the snows had held off. Oatsie intended to\nstop the winter in an Arjiki camp some twenty miles on. In the spring she would head back to the\nEmerald City, making the northern route through Ugabu, and the Pertha Hills of Gillikin. Elphie\nthought of sending a note to Glinda, if after all these years she was still there-but, being unable to\ndecide yes, she decided no.\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d said Oatsie, \u201cwe\u2019ll see Kiamo Ko. The mountain stronghold of the ruling clan of\nthe Arjikis. Are you ready, Sister Elphie?\u201d\nShe was teasing, and Elphie didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI am no longer a sister, I am a witch,\u201d she said, and\ntried to think poisonous thoughts at Oatsje. But Oatsie was a stronger person than the cook,\napparently, for she just laughed and went on her way.\nThe Grasstrail Train stopped on the side of a small tarn. The others said its water was\nrefreshing, though Icy cold; Elphie didn\u2019t know or care about that. But in the middle was an island-a\ntiny thing, the size of a mattress, sprouting one leafless tree like an umbrella that has lost its fabric.\nBefore Elphaba could quite make it out-the evening light came early at this time of year, and\neven earlier in the mountains-Killyjoy had plunged feverishly into the water, and splashed and swum\nhis way to the island, intent on some small movement or interesting scent he had picked up. He\nferreted in the sedge, and then clamped his teeth-the most woiflike of his features-gently around the\nskull of a small beast in the grass.\nElphie couldn\u2019t see but it looked like a baby.\nOatsie screamed, Liir quivered like a blob of jelly, Killyjoy released his grip, but only to get a\nfurther hold; he was drooling over the scalp of the thing he had caught.\nThere was no way to go through the water-that would be death- But her feet went Out anyway-\n\n\fThey hit the water hard, the water hit hard back- The water turned to ice as she ran-foot by foot of\nice under foot\nby foot of hurry. A silvering plate formed instantly, cantilevering forward, making a cold safe\nbridge to the islandWhere Killyjoy could be scolded, and the baby saved, though she hadn\u2019t dared hope she could\nbe in time. She pried Killyjoy\u2019s jaws apart, and scooped up the thing. It shivered in terror and the\ncold. Its bright black eyes were alert and watching, ready to upbraid or condemn or love, same as\nany capable adult thing.\nThe others were surprised to see it, as surprised as they\u2019d been to see the ice form, perhaps by\nsome magic spell left on the tarn from some passing wizard or witch. It was a small monkey-of the\nvariety called the snow monkey. A baby abandoned by its mother and its tribe, or maybe separated\nby accident?\nIt didn\u2019t think much of Killyjoy but it liked the warmth of the wagon.\nThey pitched their camp halfway up the perilous slope to Kiamo Ko. The castle rose in steep\nblack angles out of black rock. Elphie could see it perched above them like an eagle with folded\nwings; its conical-roofed towers, its battlements and bartizans, its portcullis and arrow-slit\nwindows-they all belied its original intention as the head of a waterworks. Below it wound a\npowerful tributary of the Vinkus River on which the Ozma Regent once had meant to build a dam and\nchannel water into the center of Oz-back when the droughts were their most threatening. Fiyero\u2019s\nfather had taken this stronghold by siege and storm and made it the seat of the Arjiki princes, before\ndying and leaving the clan leadership to his only son, if Elphaba remembered rightly.\nThe small luggage was packed, the bees hummed (their melodies ever more amusing as she\nlistened, week by week), Killyjoy was still sulking over being denied the kill, the crows sensed that\na change was coming and wouldn\u2019t eat dinner. The monkey, who was called Chistery because of the\nsound he made, chittered and chattered now that he was warm and safe.\nAround the campfire good-byes were spoken, a few toasts, even a few regrets. The sky was\nblacker than it had been before: perhaps it was the contrast of the whiteness of snowy peaks all\naround. Liir showed up with a parcel of clothing and some sort of musical instrument, and said goodbyes too.\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re stopping here, are you?\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cwith you.\u201d\n\u201cWith the crows, with the monkey, with the bees, with the dog, and with the Witch?\u201d she said.\n\u201cWith me?\u201d\n\u201cWhere else can I go?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cI can take care of the dog,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI can collect the honey for you.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes no difference to me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAll tight,\u201d he said, and so Liir prepared to enter his father\u2019s house.\nSarima,\u201d said her youngest sister, \u201cwake up. Naptime\u2019s over. We have\na houseguest at supper, and I need to know if we have to kill a hen.\nThere are so few left, and what we give the traveler we miss all winter in\neggs. . . What do you think?\u201d\nThe Dowager Princess of the Arjikis groaned. \u201cDetails, details,\u201d she said, \u201ccan\u2019t I train you to\nfigure out anything for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d snapped the sister, \u201cI shall decide, and thenyou can go without your morning egg\nwhen we\u2019re one short.\u201d\n\u201cOh Six, don\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Sarima, \u201cit\u2019s just that I\u2019m scarcely awake. Who is it? Some\n\n\fpatriarch with bad breath, who plans to bore us with tales of the hunting he did fifty years ago? Why\ndo we allow it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a woman-more or less,\u201d said Six.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s uncalled for,\u201d said Sarima, sitting up. \u201cWe are none of us the blushing nymphs we\nonce were, Six.\u201d From across the room she saw herself reflected in the wardrobe glass: pale as milk\npudding, her still pretty face nestled in the puddles of fat that fell according to the laws of gravity.\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re the youngest, Six, and can still locate your waist, there\u2019s no need to be unkind.\u201d\nSix pouted. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a woman, then: so chicken or no? Tell me now so Four can hack off\nits head and get to plucking, or we won\u2019t eat before midnight.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have fruit and cheese and bread and fish. Is there fish in the fishwell, I suppose?\u201d Yes,\nthere was. Six turned to go, but remembered to say, \u201cI brought you a glass of sweet tea, it\u2019s there on\nyour vanity.\u201d\n\u201cBless you. Now tell me, without sarcasm if you please, what\u2019s our guest like, really?\u201d\n\u201cGreen as sin, thin and crooked, older than any of us. Dressed in black like an old maunt-but not\nall that old. I\u2019d guess about, oh, thirty, thirty-two? She won\u2019t give her name.\u201d\n\u201cGreen? How divine,\u201d said SarIma.\n\u201cDivine isn\u2019t the word that comes to mind,\u201d said Six.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean green with jealousy-you mean actually green?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s from jealousy, I could not say, but she is surely green. Genuine grass green.\u201d\n\u201cOh la. Well, I\u2019ll wear white tonight so as not to clash. Is she alone?\u201d\n\u201cShe came in with the caravan we saw down in the valley yesterday. She stopped here with a\nlittle company of beasts-a wolfdog, a hive of bees, a youth, some crows, and a baby monkey.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll she do with all of them in the mountains in winter?\u201d\n\u201cAsk her yourself.\u201d Six wrinkled her nose. \u201cShe made me shudder.\u201d\n\u201cHalf-set gelatin makesyou shudder. When\u2019s dinner tonight?\u201d\n\u201cSeven chimes and a half. She turns my stomach.\u201d\nSix left, having run out of expressions of disgust, and Sarima had her tea in bed until her\nbladder complained. Six had banked up the fire and drawn the curtains, but Sarima pulled them back\nto look down into the courtyard. Kiamo Ko boasted corner turrets and towers, built on massive\ncircular salients thrusting upward from the stone of the mountain itself. After the Arjiki clan had\nwrested the building from the waterworks commission, they had added toothy crenellations for\ndefense. Despite the reworkings, the plan of the house was still simple. It was built in the general\nshape of a U, a central hall with two long narrow wings thrusting forward around a steeply pitched\nyard. When it rained, the water churned over the cobbles, and slipped out under the carved gates of\niron oak and jasper panels, past the sickly cluster of village houses nestled up against the castle\u2019s\noutside walls. At this hour the courtyard was charcoal gray. Cold and filthy with scraps of hay and\nbits of leaf flying in the wind. There was a light in the old cobbler\u2019s shed, and smoke spinning from\nthe chimney that badly wanted repointing-like everything else in this decaying manse. Sarima was\nglad the guest hadn\u2019t been shown into the house proper. As Dowager Princess of the Arjikis, she\nenjoyed the privilege of welcoming a traveler into the private chambers of Kiamo Ko.\nAfter bathing, snc urcsscu in a wniic snut won wniic piping, and put on the beautiful torque that\nhad arrived, like a message from the Other Land, from her dear departed husband several months\nafter the Incident. Out of habit Sarima shed a few tears admiring herself within the flat embrace of its\njeweled, segmented collar. If it was too dressy for this itinerant, Sarima could always drape a\nnapkin over it. But she would still know it was there. Even before her tears had dried she was\nhumming, looking forward to the novelty of a guest.\nShe peeped in on the children before going down. They were jumpy; strangers always did that\n\n\fto them. Irji and Manek, twelve and eleven, were almost old enough to want to bust out of this nest of\nvenomous doves. Irji was soft and cried a lot, but Manek was a little bantam, always had been. If she\nlet them go off to the Grasslands with the clan, in the summer migration, they both might have their\nthroats slit-there were too many clansmen to claim leadership for themselves or their sons. So\nSarima had kept her boys near.\nHer daughter, Nor, long-legged and thumb-sucking at nine years old, still needed a lap to crawl\ninto before going to sleep. Dressed for the meal, Sarima was inclined to forbid it, but relented. Nor\nhad a delicate lisp and she said wunning in the wain for running in the rain. She befriended stones\nand candles and blades of grass that grew against all logic in the cracks of the coping stones around\nthe windows. She sighed and rubbed her face against the torque and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a boy too, Mama.\nWe played with him in the mill yard.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he like? Is he green too?\u201d\n\u201cNah. He\u2019s all right. He\u2019s a big baby-fat and strong, and Manek was throwing stones at him to\nsee how far they would bounce off him. He let him do it. Maybe if you\u2019re so fat it doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt it. What\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\u201cLiir. Isn\u2019t that a queer name?\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds foreign. And his mother?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her name and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s his mother. He wouldn\u2019t say when we asked. Irji\nsaid he must be a bastard. Liir said he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019s nice.\u201d She moved her right thumb to her\nmouth, and with her left hand felt the cloth of Sarima\u2019s gown just below the torque, until she found a\nnipple, and she ran her thumb over it lovingly as if it\n- white\nwere a small pet. \u201cManek made him pull down his trousers so we could make sure his thing\nwasn\u2019t green.\u201d\nSarima disapproved-on the grounds of hospitality if nothing else-but was compelled to ask,\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\n\u201cOh wellyou know.\u201d Nor turned her head into her mother\u2019s neck, and then sneezed from the\npowder with which Sarima kept her chins from chafing. \u201cStupid-looking boy\u2019s thing. Smaller than\nManek and Irji. But not green. I was so bored I didn\u2019t look much.\u201d\n\u201cNeither would I. That was very rude.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make him do it. Manek did!\u201d\n\u201cWell, no more of that. Now let\u2019s have a story before sleeping. I\u2019ve got to go down soon, so a\nshort one. What do you want to hear, my little one?\u201d\n\u201cI want to hear the story of the Witch and the fox babies.\u201d\nWith less drama than usual Sarima rattled through the tale of how the three fox babies were\nkidnapped and caged and fed to fatness, in preparation for a cheese-and-foxling casserole, and how\nthe Witch went to get fire from the sun to cook them. But when the Witch came back to her cave,\nexhausted and in possession of father flame, the foxlings outwitted her by singing a lullaby to make\nher sleep. When the Witch\u2019s arm fell, the flame from the sun burned the door off the cage, and out the\nfoxlings ran. Then they howled down old mother moon to come and stand as an unmovable door in\nthe entrance of the cave. Sarima ended with the traditional back-and-forth. \u201cAnd there the wicked\nold Witch stayed, for a good long time.\u201d\n\u201cDid she ever come out?\u201d asked Nor, doing her line from an almost hypnagogic state.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said Sarima, kissing and biting her daughter on the wrist, which made them both\ngiggle, and then lights out.\nThe stairs from Sarima\u2019s private apartment ran without railings down into the castle keep,\nhugging first one wall and then, after the corner, another. She descended the first flight full of grace\n\n\fand self-possession, her white skirts billowing, her torque a yoke of soft colors and precious metals,\nher face a careful composition of welcome.\nAt the landing she saw the traveler, sitting on a bench in an alcove, looking up at her.\nShe made it down the second ffight to the flagstoned level, aware of\nthe cynicism that seethed beneath her loyal remembrance of Fiyero, aware of her overbite; of\nher lost prettiness; of her weight; of the silliness of being the doyenne over nothing but irritating\nchildren and backbiting younger sisters; of the thin pretense of authority that scarcely masked her fear\nof the present, the future, and even the past.\n\u201cHow do you do,\u201d she managed.\n\u201cYou are Sarima,\u201d said the woman, standing, her stalactite of chin thrust forward like a rotted\nswede.\n\u201cLikely to be!\u201d she said, glad of the torque; it seemed like a shield now, to protect her heart\nfrom being punctured by that chin. \u201cGreetings to you, my friend. Yes, I am Sarima, mistress of Kiamo\nKo. Where do you come from, and how are you called?\u201d\n\u201cI come from the back of the wind,\u201d said the woman, \u201cand I have given up my name so often I\ndon\u2019t like to bring it out again for you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you are welcome here,\u201d said Sarima as smoothly as she could, \u201cbut if we have nothing\nelse to call you by, you will have to be Auntie. Will you come in to dine? We\u2019ll be serving out\nsoon.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t eat until we speak,\u201d said the guest. \u201cNot under your roof in false pretenses for one\nnight; I\u2019d rather lie at the bottom of a lake. Sarima, I know who you are. I went to school with your\nhusband. I\u2019ve known about you for a dozen years or so.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Sarima then, things clicking. The old, treasured details of her husband\u2019s life\ncame rushing up. \u201cOf course Fiyero talked of you-and of your sister, Nessie, right? Nessarose. And\nof the glamorous Glinda, with whom I think he was a little in love, and the playful inverted boys, and\nAvaric, and solid old Boq! I had wondered if that happy time of his life was always to be selfcontained, always his and never mine-you are good to have come to call. I should have liked a\nseason or two at Shiz, but I didn\u2019t have the brains, I fear, nor my family the money. I would have\nremembered you in a minute, well, the color of your skin, there\u2019s nothing like it, is there? Or am I too\nprovincial?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s unique,\u201d said the guest. \u201cBefore we say ten sentences of polite nonsense to each other,\nI have to tell you something, Sarima. I think I was the cause of Fiyero\u2019s death-\u201c\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the only one,\u201d interrupted Sarima, \u201cit\u2019s a national pastime out here, blaming\noneself for the death of a prince. An opportu\nnity for public grieving and atonement, which I secretly believe people enjoy just a little bit.\u201d\nThe guest twisted her fingers, as if to pry open a space for herself in Sarima\u2019s opinions. \u201cI can\ntell you how, I want to tell you-\u201c\n\u201cNot unless I want to hear it, which is my prerogative. This is my house and I choose to hear\nwhat I want.\u201d\n\u201cYou must hear it, so that I can be forgiven,\u201d said the woman, turning her shoulders this way\nand that, almost as if she were a beast of burden with an invisible yoke on her.\nSarima did not like to be ambushed in her own home. Time enough to consider these sudden\nimplications. When she felt up to it. And not until. She reminded herself that she was in charge. And\nthus she could afford to be kind.\n\u201cIf I remember rightly,\u201d said Sarima-her mind was racing with memory-\u201cyou\u2019re the one, Fiyero\ntalked of you, of course-Elphaba, that\u2019s it-you\u2019re the one who didn\u2019t believe in the soul. I remember\nthat much, so what\u2019s to forgive, dearie? I know you\u2019re travel weary-it\u2019s impossible to get here\n\n\fwithout being travel weary-and you need a good hot meal and a few nights of sleep, and we\u2019ll chat\nsome morning next week?\u201d\nSarima linked her arm with Elphaba\u2019s. \u201cBut I\u2019ll preserve your name from them, if you like,\u201d\nsaid Sarima. She walked Elphaba through the tall warped oak doors into the dining hall and called,\n\u201cLook who\u2019s here, Auntie Guest.\u201d The sisters were standing beside their chairs, hungry and curious\nand impatient. Four had the ladle in the tureen, snm , Six had dressed in a hostile puce; Two and\nThree, the twins, looked piously at their prayer cards; Five was smoking and blowing concentric\nrings toward the platter of yellow eyeless fish they had dragged up from the underground lake.\n\u201cSisters, rejoice, an old friend of Fiyero\u2019s has come to share fond memories and enliven our lives.\nWelcome her as you do me.\u201d Perhaps an unfortunate choice of words, as the sisters all resented and\ndespised Sarima. Why had she married someone who would die so early and condemn them not just\nto spinsterhood but to deprivation and denial?\nElphaba didn\u2019t speak through the entire meal or look up from her plate. She devoured the fish,\nthough, and the cheese and the fruit. Sarima deduced from her eating habits that she had lived under a\nrule of silence at meals, and wasn\u2019t surprised, later, to hear about the mauntery.\nThey took a glass of precious sherry in the music room, and Six entertained them with a\nwobbling nocturne. The guest looked miserable, which made the sisters happy. Sarima sighed. The\none thing that could be said about the guest was this: She was older than Sarima. Perhaps, for the\nshort while of her stay, Elphaba would come out of that sulk and lend an ear to hear how troubling\nand trying Sarima\u2019s life was. It would be nice to chat with someone not in the family.\nA week passed before Sarima said to Three, \u201cPlease tell our Auntie Guest that I\u2019d like to see\nher tomorrow for elevenses in the Solar.\u201d Sarima thought that Elphaba had had enough time now to\nget the measure of things. The suffering green woman was in some sort of slow-motion thrall, or fit.\nShe moved jerkily, stalking about the courtyard, or stamping in to meals as if trying to poke holes in\nthe flooring with her heels. Her elbows were always bent at right angles, and her hands clenched and\nunclenched themselves.\nSarima felt stronger than ever, which wasn\u2019t very. It did her some good to have a contemporary\naround, however thwarted she might be. The sisters disapproved of Sarima\u2019s cordiality, but the\nhigher mountain passes were already closed for the winter, and you just couldn\u2019t send a stranger\npacking into the treacherous valleys. The sisters conferred in their parlor, as they busied themselves\nknitting hateful gray potholders for the undeserving poor at Lurlinemas. She\u2019s sick, they said; she\u2019s\ninert, unfinished (even more than they were, was the unspoken corollary, an immenseiy gratifying\nnotion); she\u2019s damned. And is that fat balloon of a boy her son, or a child slave, or is he one of her\nfamiliars? Behind Sarima\u2019s back they called the woman living in the cobbleshed Auntie Witch,\nechoing the old legends of Kumbricia, which were viler-and more persistent-in the Kells than\nelsewhere in Oz.\nIt was Manek, Sarima\u2019s middle child, who was the most curious. One morning, as the boys all\nstood on a battlement pissing over the side (a game poor Nor had to pretend no interest in), Manek\nsaid, \u201cWhat if we peed on Auntie? Would she scream?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d turn you into a toad,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cNo, I mean would it hurt her? She looks like water gives her thi aches and shakes. Does she\neven drink it? Or does it make her insides hurt?\u201d\nLiir, not an especially observant child, said. \u201cI think she doesn\u2019 drink it. Sometimes she washes\nthings, but she uses sticks and brushes We better not pee on her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does she do with all those bees and the monkey? An they magic?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cWhat kind of magic?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They stepped away from the dizzying drop and No came running up. \u201cI have a\nmagic straw,\u201d she said, holding up a browi bristle. \u201cFrom the Witch\u2019s broom.\u201d\n\u201cIs the broom magic?\u201d said Manek to Liir.\n\u201cYes. It can sweep the floor real fast.\u201d\n\u201cCan it talk? Is it enchanted? What does it say?\u201d\nThey got more interested, and Liir bloomed and blushed unde their curiosity. \u201cI can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s a\nsecret.\u201d\n\u201cIs it still a secret if we push you off the tower?\u201d\nLiir considered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cWill you tell us or we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me off the tower, you oafs.\u201d\n\u201cIf the broom is magic it\u2019ll come flying by and save you. Beside5 you\u2019re so fat you\u2019d probably\nbounce.\u201d\nIrji and Nor laughed at that, despite themselves. It made a ver funny picture in their minds.\n\u201cWe only want to know what secrets the broom says to you,\u201d sai\u2019 Manek with a big smile. \u201cSo\ntell us. Or we\u2019ll push you off.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not being nice, he\u2019s company,\u201d said Nor. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s g find some mice in the\npantry and make friends.\u201d\n\u201cIn a minute. Let\u2019s push Liir off the roof first.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Nor, beginning to cry. \u201cYou boys are so mean. Are yoi sure that broom is magic,\nLiir?\u201d\nBut Liir by now didn\u2019t want to say any more.\nManek tossed a pebble off the roof and it seemed a very long tim before the ping of impact.\nLiir\u2019s face had, in a matter of moments, developed deep black pockets under the eyes. He held\nhis hands down by his sides like a traitor at a court martial. \u201cThe Witch\u2019ll be so mad at you that she\nwill hate you,\u201d Liir said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Manek, taking a step forward. \u201cShe won\u2019t care. She likes the monkey\nmore than she likes you. She won\u2019t even notice if you\u2019re dead.\u201d\nLiir gasped for air. Although he had just peed, the front of his baggy trousers turned dark with\nwet. \u201cLook, Irji,\u201d said Manek, and his older brother looked. \u201cHe\u2019s not even very good at being alive\nis he? It\u2019s not like it would be much of a loss. Come on, Liir, tell roe. What did the damned broom\nsay to you?\u201d\nLiir\u2019s upper torso was going in and out like a bellows. He whispered, \u201cThe broom told methat-that-you\u2019re all going to die!\u201d\n\u201cOh, is that all,\u201d said Manek. \u201cWe already knew that. Everybody dies. We knew that already.\u201d\n\u201cYou did?\u201d said Liir, who hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Irji said, \u201ccome on, let\u2019s catch some mice in the pantry and we can cut off their\ntails and use Nor\u2019s magic straw to prick their eyes.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Nor, but liji had swiped the straw from her. Manek and Irji went clattering, looselimbed as marionettes, along the parapet and down the stairs. With a huge, aggrieved sigh, Liir\ncomposed himself and adjusted his clothes, and followed them like a condemned dwarf laborer in\nthe emerald mines. Nor stayed behind, her arms folded defiantly, her chin working with frustration.\nThen she spit over the edge and felt better, and chased after the boys.\nAt midmorning, Six showed the guest into the Solar. With a smirk behind Auntie\u2019s back, she\ndeposited a tray of cruel little biscuits, hard as slate, on a table covered with a carpet gone brown\nand patternless. Sarima, having made her way through what she could of her daily spiritual ablutions,\nfelt ready.\n\n\f\u201cYou\u2019ve been here a week and it\u2019s likely to be longer,\u201d said Sarima, allowing Six to pour out\nsome gallroot coffee before dismissing her. \u201cThe trail north is snowed in by now, and there\u2019s not a\nsafe haven between here and the plains. The winters are hard in the mountains, and while we can\nmake do with our stores and our own company, we treasure a change.\nMilk? I do not know exactly what you had-intended. Once you had visited us sufficiently, I\nmean.\u201d\n\u201cThere are rumors of caves in these Kells,\u201d Elphaba said, almost more to herself than to\nSarima. \u201cI lived for some years at the Cloister of Saint Glinda in the Shale Shallows, outside of the\nEmerald City. Dignitaries would visit, and while we were often under a vow of silence, nonetheless\npeople would talk of what they knew. Monastic cells. I had thought, when I was done here, that I\nmight take myself to a cave and-and-\u201c\n\u201cAnd set up housekeeping,\u201d said Sarima, as if this were as usual as marrying and bearing\nbabies. \u201cSome do it, I know. There\u2019s an old hermit on the western slope of Broken Bottle-that\u2019s a\npeak nearby-they say he\u2019s been there for some years, and has reverted to a more primitive moment of\nnature. Of his nature, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cA life without words,\u201d Elphie said, looking in her coffee and not drinking it.\n\u201cThey say this hermit has forgotten about personal hygiene,\u201d said Sarima, \u201cwhich, given how\nthe boys smell when they go unwashed for a couple of weeks, strikes me as nature\u2019s defense against\nmarauding beasts.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here for a long time,\u201d Elphie said, twisting her head on her neck like a\nparrot and looking at Sarima in an odd way. Oh, beware, thought Sarima carefully, though she tended\nto like this guest:\nBeware, she\u2019s taking the direction of the discussion into her own hands. This won\u2019t do. But the\nguest went on: \u201cI had thought that I would have a night or two, maybe three, and could find myself a\nhidey-hole before winter set in. I was working on the wrong calendar, I was thinking of how, and\nwhen, winter came to Shiz and the Emerald City. But you\u2019re six weeks ahead here.\u201d\n\u201cAhead in the autumn and behind in the spring, alas,\u201d said Sarima. She took her feet off her\nhassock and placed them on the floor, flatly, to indicate seriousness. \u201cNow, my new friend, there are\nsome things I need to say to you.\u201d\n\u201cI have things too,\u201d Elphie said, but Sarima went on this time.\n\u201cYou will think me an unpolished person, and you are right of course. Oh, when I was selected\nto be a child bride, a good governess was hired from Gillikin to teach me and my sisters how to use\nverbs and pronouns\nand salad forks. And lately I have begun to master reading. But most of what I picked up about\npolite behavior was from what Fiyero was good enough to instruct me in when he returned from his\neducation. No doubt I make social mistakes. You have every right to snigger behind my back.\u201d\n\u201cI am not given to sniggering,\u201d snapped Elphaba.\n\u201cAs it may be. But I still have opinions, and I\u2019m observant even if unschooled. Despite my\nsheltered life, married at the age of seven as you may know, raised and reared behind castle curtain\nwalls. I trust my own sense of things and won\u2019t be dissuaded. So let me continue,\u201d she said, as\nElphaba tried to interrupt. \u201cThere is plenty of time and the sun is nice in here, isn\u2019t it? My little\nhideaway.\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have come here to-shall we say-relieve yourself of some sad business\nor other. You have the look about you. Don\u2019t be startled, my dear, if there\u2019s a look I do recognize,\nit\u2019s the look of someone carrying a burden. Remember, I listen to my sisters, year in and year out, as\nthey graciously share with me all the ways they hate me, and why.\u201d She smiled, amused at her own\nwit. \u201cYou want to throw down your burden, throw it down at my feet, or across my shoulders. You\n\n\fwant perhaps to weep a little, to say good-bye, and then to leave. And when you leave here you will\nwalk right out of the world.\u201d\n\u201cI will do no such thing,\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cYou will indeed, even if you don\u2019t know it. You will have nothing left to tie you to the world.\nBut I know my own limits, Auntie Guest, and I know what you\u2019re here for. You told me. You told me\nin the hall, you said you felt you were responsible for Fiyero\u2019s death-\u201c\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Just don\u2019t. This is my home, I am a nominal Dowager Princess of Duckshit, but I have a\nright to hear and I have a right not to hear. Even to make a traveler feel better.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to burden you, Sarima, I want to unburden you with the truth-if you permit me,\nyou are the larger, the lighter; forgiveness blesses the donor as well as the receiver.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll overlook that remark about my being the larger,\u201d said Sarima. \u201cBut I still have the right to\nchoose. And I think you wish me ill. You\nwish me ill and you don\u2019t even know it. You want to punish me for something. Maybe for not\nbeing a good enough wife to Fiyero. You wish me ill and you fool yourself to think it\u2019s some\ntherapeutic course of tablets.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know how he died, at least?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cI know it was a violent action, I know his body was never found, I know it was in a little love\nnest,\u201d said Sarima, for a minute losing her resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t care to know who it was exactly, but I\nhave heard enough about that vile Sir Chuffrey to have my strong opin-\u201c\n\u201cSir Chujfrey!\u201d\n\u201cI said no. I said no more. Now I have an offer to make of you, Auntie, if you will have it. You\nand the boy may move into the southeast tower if you like. There are a couple of big round rooms\nwith high ceilings, and good light, and you\u2019ll be out of that drafty cobbleshed, and warmer. You\u2019ll\nhave your own staircase to come and go into the main hall, and you won\u2019t bother the girls and they\nwon\u2019t trouble you. You can\u2019t stay in that cobbleshed all winter. The boy has been looking pale and\nblubbery, I think he\u2019s always cold. You\u2019re there on the condition, I\u2019m afraid, that you accept my\nfirmest word on these matters. I don\u2019t care to discuss my husband or the affairs of his death with\nyou.\u201d\nElphaba looked horror-struck, and beaten. \u201cI have no choice but to accept,\u201d she said, \u201cat least\nfor the time being. But I warn you, I intend to befriend you so thoroughly that you will change your\nmind. And I do think you need to hear things, you need to talk about them, as I do-and I can\u2019t leave\ninto the wilderness until I have your solemn promise of-\u201c\n\u201cEnough!\u201d said Sarima. \u201cCall the porter from the gatehouse and have him bring your luggage to\nthe tower. Come, I\u2019ll show you. You haven\u2019t touched your coffee.\u201d She stood. For an awkward\nmoment there was respect and suspicion, in equal measure, simmering on the carpet like the dust in\nthe sunbeams. \u201cCome,\u201d Sarima said, more softly, \u201cat the very least you need to be warm. You must\nbe able to say that much of us country mice here at Kiamo Ko.\u201d\nAs far as Elphaba was concerned, it was a witch\u2019s room, and she reveled in it. Like all good\nwitch\u2019s rooms in children\u2019s stories, it was a\nroom with bowed walls, following the essential form of a tower. It had one broad window that,\nsince it faced east, away from the wind, could be unbarred and opened without blowing everyone\nand everything out into the snowy valleys. Beyond, the Great Kells were a rank of sentinels, purpleblack when the winter sun rose over them, draining into blue-white screens as the sun moved\noverhead, and going golden and ruddy in the late afternoon. There were sometimes rumbling\ncollapses of ice and scree.\nThe winter gripped the house. Elphaba learned soon enough to stay put unless she was sure\n\n\fanother room had a warmer fire. And except for Sarima, she didn\u2019t care for the other human company\nthe house afforded. Sarima lived in the west wing, with the children: the boys Irji and Manek, the\ngirl Nor. Sarima\u2019s five sisters lived in the east wing-they were called numbers Two through Six, and\nif they had ever had other names they had withered away from disuse. By right of their\nunmarriageability, the sisters claimed the best rooms in the place, although Sarima had the Solar.\nWhere Liir curled up to sleep Elphaba did not know, but he reappeared every morning to change the\nrags at the bottom of the crows\u2019 perch. He brought her cocoa, too.\nLurlinemas drew near, and out came some tired decorations from which the gilt had all but\nvanished. The children spent a whole day tying baubles and toys to the archways, making the grownups bump their heads and curse. Manek and Irji took a saw and without permission went beyond the\ncastle walls to claim some boughs of spruce and sprigs of holly. Nor stayed behind and painted\nscenes of happy life in the castle on sheets of paper that she and Liir had found in Auntie Witch\u2019s\nroom. Liir said he couldn\u2019t draw, so he wandered off and disappeared, perhaps to stay clear of\nManek and Irji. The house fell still until there was a flurry of copper pans thrown about the kitchen.\nNor went running to see, and Liir arrived from some hiding cubby to look too.\nIt was Chistery. The monkey was having a fit, and all the sisters, baking gingerbread, were\nthrowing gobbets of batter at him, trying to knock him off the wheel that hung, noisy with swinging\nutensils, above the worktable.\n\u201cHow\u2019d he get in here?\u201d said Nor.\n\u201cGet him out, Liir, call him!\u201d said Two. But Liir had no more authority over Chistery than they\ndid. The monkey flew to the top of a\nwardrobe, then to a huge dried goods canister, and he pulled open a drawer and found a\nprecious store of raisins, which he stuffed in his mouth. Six said, \u201cGo get the ladder from the hall,\nyou two, and bring it here,\u201d but when they had, Chistery was back on the wheel, making it whirl and\nclatter like a roundabout at a carnival.\nFour put a lump of mashed melon in a bowl. Five and Three took off their aprons, ready to rush\nhim when he came down. Chistery was still eyeing the fruit when the door smacked open against the\nwall and Elphaba came lolloping in. \u201cAll this commotion, how can you hear yourselves think?\u201d she\ncried, and then took in the sight of Chistery, suddenly abject and remorseful, and of the sisters,\npoised to ensnare him in their floury aprons.\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo need to yell,\u201d said Two sulkily, quietly, but they put down their aprons.\n\u201cI mean, what is this? What is realiy going on here? You all look like Killyjoy, with blood lust\nin your faces! You\u2019re white with rage at this poor beast!\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not rage, it\u2019s flour,\u201d said Five, which made them giggle.\n\u201cYou filthy savages,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cChistery come here, come down here. Right now. You\nwomen deserve to be unmarried, so you don\u2019t bring any little savage creepy children into the world.\nDon\u2019t you ever lay a hand on this monkey, do you hear me? And how did he get out of my room\nanyway? I was in the Solar with your sister.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Nor, remembering, \u201coh, Auntie, I\u2019m sorry. It was us.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d She turned and looked at Nor as if for the first time, and Nor didn\u2019t like it much. She\nshrank back against the door of the cold cellar. \u201cWhat were you skulking about in my room for?\u201d\nsaid Elphie.\n\u201cSome paper,\u201d said Nor faintly, and in a desperate, all-or-nothing gamble, said, \u201cI made some\npaintings for everybody, do you want to see, come here.\u201d\nChistery in her arms, Elphaba followed them into the drafty hall, where the wind under the front\ndoor was making the papers flutter against the carved stone. The sisters came too, a safe distance\n\n\fbehind.\nElphie got very quiet. \u201cThis is my paper,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could use it. Look, it has\nwords on the back. Do you know what words are?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I do, do you think I am slow?\u201d responded Nor sassily.\n\u201cYou leave my papers alone,\u201d said Elphaba. She and Chistery then flew up the steps, and the\ndoor to the tower slammed behind them.\n\u201cWho wants to help roll out the gingerbread?\u201d said Two, relieved that skulls hadn\u2019t been\nknocked together. \u201cAnd this hall looks very pretty, chickadees, I\u2019m sure Preenella and Lurline will\nbe impressed tonight.\u201d The children went back into the kitchen and made gingerbread people, and\ncrows, and monkeys, and dogs, but they couldn\u2019t do bees, they were too small. When Irji and Manek\ncame in, dumping snowy greens on the slate floor, they helped at the gingerbread shapes too, but they\nmade naughty shapes that they wouldn\u2019t show the younger children, and they kept gobbling up the\nraw dough and laughing hysterically at it, which made everyone else testy.\nIn the morning the children awoke and ran downstairs to see if Lurline and Preenella had been\nthere. Sure enough, there was a brown wicker basket with a green and gold ribbon on it (a basket\nand a ribbon that Sarima\u2019s children had seen many years in a row), and in it were three small\ncolored boxes, each one with an orange, a puppet, a small sack of marbles, and a gingerbread mouse.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see one with your name on it,\u201d said Irji. \u201cLook: Irji. Manek. Nor. Guess Preenella left it\nfor you at your old house. Where did you used to live?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Liir, and started to cry.\n\u201cHere, you can have the tail of my mouse, just the tail,\u201d said Nor kindly. \u201cFirst you have to say,\nMay I please have the tail of your mouse?\u201d\n\u201cMay I please have the tail of your mouse,\u201d said Liir, though his words were almost\nunintelligible.\n\u201cAnd I promise to obey you.\u201d\nLiir mumbled on. The exchange was eventually completed. From shame, Liir didn\u2019t mention the\noversight. Sarima and the sisters never took it in.\nElphaba didn\u2019t show her face all day, but she sent down a message that Lurlinemas Eve and\nLurlinemas always made her ill, and she was tak\ning a few days in solitary comfort, and she wanted to be disturbed neither with meals, nor\nvisitors, nor noise of any kind.\nSo while Sarima took herself off to her private chapel to remember her dear husband on this\nholy day, the sisters and the children all sang carols as loudly as they could.\nA few weeks later, when the children were having snowball battles, and Sarima was\nconcocting some medicinal toddy in the kitchen, Elphie left her room at last and skulked down the\nstairs and knocked on the door of the sisters\u2019 parlor.\nThey didn\u2019t like it, but they felt obliged to welcome her. The silver tray with bottles of hard\nliquor, the precious crystal carried on donkey all the way from Dixxi House in Gillikin, the prettiest\nand red-richest of native carpets on the floor, the luxury of fireplaces at both sides of the room, each\nblazing merrily-well, they would have toned it down some had they had any warning. As it was,\nFour hid in the sofa cushions the leather volume from which she had been reading aloud, a racy\nhistory of a poor young woman beset by an abundance of handsome suitors. It had been a gift from\nFiyero once, the best gift he had ever sent the sisters-also the only one.\n\u201cWould you like some lemon barley water?\u201d said Six, ever the servant until the day she died,\nunless by luck everyone else died sooner.\n\u201cYes, all right,\u201d Elphaba said.\n\n\f\u201cDo take a seat-this seat here, you\u2019ll find it most comfy.\u201d\nElphie didn\u2019t look as if she wanted to be comfy, but she sat there anyway, stiff and uneasy in\nthat quilted cocoon of a room.\nShe took the tiniest sip possible from her drink, as if suspecting hellebore.\n\u201cI suppose I need to apologize for that flurry over Chistery,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I am your guest\nhere at Kiamo Ko. Ijust flew off the handle.\u201d\n\u201c\\Vell, you did just that,\u201d started Five, but the others said, \u201cOh, think nothing of it, we all have\ndays like that, in fact for us it usually happens on the same day, it\u2019s been that way for years . .\n\u201cIt\u2019s very taxing,\u201d Elphie said with some effort. \u201cI spent many years under a vow of silence,\nand I haven\u2019t always learned how-loud-it is\npermissible to get. Besides that, this is a foreign culture, in a way.\u201d\n\u201cWe Aijikis have always been proud of being able to speak to any other citizen in Oz,\u201d said\nTwo. \u201cWe are as equally at home with the ragged vagabond Scrow to our south as with the elite in\nthe Emerald City to our east.\u201d Not that they\u2019d ever been out of the Vinkus.\n\u201cA little nibble?\u201d said Three, bringing out a tin of marzipan fruits.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elphie said, \u201cbut I wonder what you could tell me of your sister\u2019s particular sadness.\u201d\nThey sat poised, tempted, and suspicious.\n\u201cI enjoy my chats with her in the Solar,\u201d said Elphie, \u201cbut whenever the talk gets around to her\ndeparted husband-whom as you may realize I myself knew-she is unwilling to discuss a thing.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, it was so sad,\u201d said Two.\n\u201cA tragedy,\u201d said Three.\n\u201cFor her,\u201d said Four.\n\u201cFor us,\u201d said Five.\n\u201cAuntie Guest, take a little orange liqueur in your lemon barley,\u201d said Six, \u201cit comes from the\nbalmy slopes of the Lesser Kells and is quite a luxury.\u201d\n\u201cWell, just a drop,\u201d said Elphie, but didn\u2019t sip it. She put her elbows on her knees and leaned\nforward and said, \u201cPlease tell me how she learned of Fiyero\u2019s death.\u201d\nThere was a silence. The sisters avoided casting glances at one another, busying themselves\nwith the pleats of their skirts. After a pause, it was Two who said, \u201cThat sad day. It stings in the\nmemory still.\u201d\nThe others adjusted themselves in their seats, turning slightly toward her. Elphaba blinked\ntwice, looking like one of her own crows.\nTwo told the tale, without sentiment or drama. One of Fiyero\u2019s business colleagues, an Arjiki\ntrader, had come through the mountain pass at the first spring thaw, on the back of a mountain skark.\nHe asked to meet with Sanma and insisted her sisters be around to support her at his woeful news.\nHe told them how, on Lurlinemas, he had received at his club an anonymous message that Fiyero had\nbeen murdered. There was an address in a disreputable area-not even a residential neighborhood.\nThe clansman hired a couple of brutes and broke down the door of the warehouse. Inside was a\nsmall apartment hidden upstairs, a place of assig\nnation, obviously. (The clansman reported this without flinching, perhaps as a powermongering maneuver.) There was evidence of struggle and massive quantities of blood, so thick in\nplaces that it was still tacky. The body had been removed, and it was never recovered.\nElphaba only nodded, grimly, at this recounting.\n\u201cFor a year,\u201d continued Two, \u201cour dear distraught Sarima refused to believe he was really\ndead. We would not have been surprised at a ransom note. But by the following Lurlinemas, when no\nfurther word about it had arrived, we had to accept the inevitable. Besides, the clan had gone on as\nlong as it could with an ad hoc collaborative leadership; they demanded a single chief, and one was\n\n\fput forward, and he\u2019s served well. When Irji comes of age he may claim the rights of progenitorship,\nif he\u2019s bold enough; he is not yet bold at all. Manek is the more obvious candidate, but he\u2019s only\nsecond in line.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what does Sarima believe happened?\u201d said Elphie. \u201cAnd you? All of you?\u201d\nNow that the grimmest part of the story had been told, the other sisters felt they could chime in.\nIt emerged that Sarima had for some years suspected Fiyero of having an affair with an old college\nchum named Glinda, a Gillikinese girl of legendary beauty.\n\u201cLegendary?\u201d Elphie said.\n\u201cHe told us all how charming she was, how self-effacing, what grace and sparkle-\u201c\n\u201cIs it all that likely he\u2019d gush on and on about a woman he was committing adultery with?\u201d\n\u201cMen,\u201d said Two, \u201care, as we all know, both cruel and cunning.\nWhat better ruse than to admit fervently and often that he admired her?\nSarima had no grounds on which to accuse him of slyness and deception.\nHe never stopped being attentive to her-\u201c\n\u201cIn his cold, morose, withdrawn, embittered fashion,\u201d interjected Three.\n\u201cHardly the thing one reads about in novels,\u201d said Four.\n\u201cif one read novels,\u201d said Five.\n\u201cWhich we don\u2019t,\u201d said Six, closing her lips over a marzipan pear.\n\u201cAnd so Sarima believes her husband was carrying on with this- this-\u201c\n\u201cThis dazzler,\u201d said Two. \u201cYou must have known her, didn\u2019t you go to Shiz?\u201d\n\u201cI knew her a bit,\u201d Elphie said, her mouth forgetting to shut itself. She was having a hard time\nkeeping up with the multiple narrators. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in years.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is clear in Sarima\u2019s mind what happened,\u201d said Two.\n\u201cGlinda was-for all I know still is-married to a wealthy older gentleman named Sir Chuifrey.\nHe must have suspected something, and had her followed, and found out what was going on. Then he\nhad some thugs kill the bastard. I mean poor Fiyero. Doesn\u2019t that make sense?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely plausible,\u201d Elphie said slowly. \u201cBut is there any proof?\u201d\n\u201cNo proof at all,\u201d said Four. \u201cIf there were, family honor would have required a retributive\nmurder of Sir Chuifrey. But he may still be in robust good health. No, it\u2019s only a theory, but it\u2019s what\nSanma believes.\u201d\n\u201cClings to,\u201d said Six.\n\u201cAnd why not,\u201d said Five.\n\u201cIt\u2019s her prerogative,\u201d said Three.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s her prerogative,\u201d said Two sadly. \u201cBesides, think of it. If your husband were\nmurdered, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to bear if you thought he deserved it, even just a little?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Elphie said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do we,\u201d admitted Two, \u201cbut we think that\u2019s what she thinks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Elphie asked, studying the pattern in the carpet, the blood red lozenges, the thorny\nmargins, the beasts and acanthus leaves and rose medallions. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cWe hardly can be expected to subscribe to a unanimous opinion,\u201d said Two, but she barreled\nahead anyway. \u201cIt seems reasonable to suppose that unbeknownst to us, Fiyero had gotten involved\nin some political enterprise in the Emerald City.\u201d\n\u201cA stay that was to be a month became four,\u201d said Four.\n\u201cHad he political-sensibilities?\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cHe was the Prince of the Arjikis,\u201d Five reminded them all. \u201cHe had connectionsresponsibilities-allegiances-who of us could guess at them? It was his duty to have opinions on\nthings we shouldn\u2019t need to know about.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWas he sympathetic to the Wizard?\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cAre you saying was he involved in any of those campaigns? Those-pogroms? First the\nQuadlirigs, then the Animals?\u201d said Three. \u201cYou look surprised that we should know about these\nthings. Do you think we\u2019re so very removed from the rest of Oz?\u201d\n\u201cWe are removed,\u201d said Two. \u201cBut we listen to talk. We like to feed travelers when they come\nto stop. We know life can be rotten out there.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wizard is a despot,\u201d said Four.\n\u201cOur home is our castle,\u201d said Five at the same time. \u201cSome removal from all this is healthy.\nWe retain our moral fiber, unsullied.\u201d\nThey all smirked, simultaneously.\n\u201cBut do you think Fiyero had an opinion about the Wizard?\u201d Elphaba asked again, pressing with\nsome urgency.\n\u201cHe kept his own counsel,\u201d snapped Two. \u201cFor the sake of sweet Lurline, dear Auntie, he was\na prince and a man!-and we were nothing bitt his younger, dependent sisters-in-law! Do you think he\nwould confide in us? He could have been a high-level crony of the Wizard for all we know! He\nsurely would\u2019ve had liaisons with the Palace, he was a prince. Even if only of our small tribe. What\nhe did with those liaisons-how are we to say? But we don\u2019t think he died as the victim of a jealous\nhusband. Maybe we\u2019re sheltered, but we don\u2019t. We think he got caught in the crossfire of some fringe\nstruggle. Or he was found out in the act of betrayal of one excitable group or other. He was a\nhandsome man,\u201d said Two, \u201cand none of us would deny it, then or now. But he was intense and\nprivate and we doubt he\u2019d have loosened up enough to have an affair.\u201d By the smallest gesture-a\nsucking in of her abdomen and a squaring of her shoulders-Two betrayed the foundation of her\nposition: How could he have succumbed to this Glinda\u2019s charms if he had been able to resist his\nown sisters-in-law?\n\u201cBut,\u201d Elphie asked in a small voice, \u201cdo you really think he was a spy for someone?\u201d\n\u201cWhy was his body never found?\u201d said Two. \u201cIf it had been a jealous rage, his body needn\u2019t\nhave been removed. Perhaps he hadn\u2019t died yet. Perhaps he was taken to be tortured. No, in our\nlimited experience, we think that this smacks of treachery of a political stripe, not a romantic one.\u201d\n\u201cI-\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pale, dear. Six, please, a beaker of water-\u201c\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIt\u2019s just so-one never thought at the time- I never. Shall I tell you what\nlittle I know of it? And perhaps you can mention it to Sarima.\u201d She began to pace. \u201cI saw Fiyero-\u201c\nBut, at the oddest possible moment, family solidarity kicked in. \u201cDear Auntie Guest,\u201d said Two,\nin a responsible tone, \u201cwe are under the strictest orders from our sister not to allow you to tire\nyourself by chatting about Fiyero and the sad circumstances of his death.\u201d Clearly Two had to work\nto get this out, as the appetite to hear what Elphaba had to say was huge. Stomachs were rumbling for\nthe meat of it. But propriety won out, or fear of Sarima\u2019s wrath if she were to find out. \u201cNo,\u201d said\nTwo again, \u201cno, I\u2019m afraid we mustn\u2019t express undue interest. We may not listen and we will not tell\nSarima what we hear.\u201d\nIn the end, Elphaba left them, drooping. \u201cAnother time,\u201d she kept saying, \u201cwhen you\u2019re ready,\nwhen she\u2019s ready. You see it\u2019s essential; there\u2019s so much grief she could be released from-and that\nshe herself could lift, too-\u201c\n\u201cGood-bye for now,\u201d they said, and the door closed behind her. The fires in the twin fireplaces\nmirrored back and forth across the room, and they took up positions of frustrated worthiness, at\nhaving to obey their older sister-curse her to hell.\nIce crusted the roofs, dislodged tiles, and dripped dirtily into the private chambers, the music\nroom, the towers. Elphaba took to wearing her hat indoors to avoid the random icy dart on her scalp.\n\n\fThe crows were mildewy around the beak and had algae between the claws. The sisters finished\ntheir novel, and collectively sighed-for life, for life!-and began to read it again, as they had done for\neight years. In the fierce updraft from the valley, the snow seemed as often to be rising as falling. The\nchildren adored it.\nOne glum afternoon Sarima bedecked herself in red woolen wraps and, out of boredom, went\nwandering through musty, disused rooms. She located a staircase in a trapezoidal, slanting shaftperhaps this high\nalcove leaned against the side of the gable you couldn\u2019t see, she wasn\u2019t good at imagining\narchitecture in three dimensions. She mounted the stairs anyway. At the top, through a crude\ngrillwork, she saw a figure in the white gloom. Sarima coughed so as not to startle her.\nElphaba was bent almost double over a huge folio laid out on a carpenter\u2019s work bench. She\nturned, surprised but not very, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve had the same inclination, how curious.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve found some books, I\u2019d completely forgotten,\u201d said Sarima. She could read now, but\nnot well, and books made her feel inferior. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re all about. So many\nwords, you\u2019d hardly think the world deserved such scrutiny.\u201d\n\u201cOver here is an archaic geography,\u201d said Elphie, \u201cand some records of usufruct pacts among\nvarious families of the Arjiki-I bet there are leaders who would be very happy to see these. Unless\nthey\u2019re outdated. Some texts that Fiyero had in Shiz-I recognize them too, the life sciences course of\nstudies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this big thing-purple pages and silver ink, how grand.\u201d\n\u201cI found it on the floor of this wardrobe. It seems to be a Grimmerie,\u201d Elphie said, running her\nhand down a page only softly buckled with moisture. It made a pretty contrast, her hand on the\nvellum.\n\u201cWhat is that, besides beautiful?\u201d\n\u201cAs I understand it,\u201d Elphie said, \u201ca sort of encyclopedia of things numinous. Magic; and of the\nspirit world; and of things seen and unseen; and of things once and future. I can only make out a line\nhere or there. Look how it scrambles itself as you watch.\u201d She pointed to a paragraph of handlettered text. Sarima peered. Though her skill at reading was minimal, she gaped at what she saw.\nThe letters floated and rearranged themselves on the page, as if enlivened. The page was changing its\nmind as they watched it. The letters clotted together in a big black snarl, like a mound of ants. Then\nElphaba turned a page. \u201cHere, this section is a book of beasts.\u201d There were elegant, attenuated\ndrawings in blood red and gold leaf, on the front and rear elevations of (it seemed) an angel, with\nnotes in a fine hand on the aerodynamic aspects of holiness. The wings flexed up and down and the\nangel smiled with a saucy sort of sanctity. \u201cAnd a recipe on this page. It says \u2018Of apples with black\nskin and white flesh: to fill the stomach with greed unto Death.\u201d\n\u201cI remember this book now,\u201d Sarima said. \u201cI do remember how it came to be here, I even put it\nup here myself; I had forgotten. Well, books are so easy to set aside, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\nElphie looked up, her eyes leveling out under her smooth, rocklike brow. \u201cTell me, Sarima,\nplease.\u201d\nThe Dowager Princess of Kiamo Ko was flustered. She went to a small window and tried to\nopen it, but encrustations of ice prevented her. So she sat down in a flump on a packing crate and\ntold Elphaba the story. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly when, but it was a long time ago, when\neveryone was young and slim. Beloved Fiyero was still alive but he was off in the Grasslands with\nthe tribe. Complaining of a headache, she was home in the castle all alone. The bell at the\ndrawbridge sounded and she went to see who it was.\n\u201cMadame Morrible,\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cSome Kumbric Witch or other.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was no madame. It was an elderly man in a tunic and leggings, with a cloak badly in\n\n\fneed of attention by a seamstress. He said he was a sorcerer, but perhaps he was just mad. He asked\nfor a meal and a bath, which he got, and then he said he wanted to pay by giving me this book. I told\nhim with a castle to run I didn\u2019t have much time for frivolity, reading and such. He said never mind.\u201d\nSarima drew her robes about her, and traced a pattern in the cold dust on a nearby stack of\ncodexes. \u201cHe told me a fabulous tale and persuaded me to take this thing from him. He said that it\nwas a book of knowledge, and that it belonged in another world, but it wasn\u2019t safe there. So he had\nbrought it here-where it could be hidden and out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a load of tripe,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cIf it came from another world I shouldn\u2019t be able to read\nany of it. And I can make out a little.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s as magic as he says?\u201d said Sarima. \u201cBut you know, I believed him. He said there\nwas more congress between worlds than anyone would credit, that our world has attributes of his,\nand his of ours, a kind of leakage effect, or an infection maybe. He had a long fringy whiteand-gray\nbeard, and a very kind and abstracted manner, and he smelled of garlic and sour cream.\u201d\n\u201cIndisputable proof of other-worldliness-\u201c\n\u201cDon\u2019t mock me,\u201d said Sarima blandly, \u201cyou\u2019ve asked me, so I\u2019m\ntelling you. He said it was too powerful to be destroyed, but too threatening-to that other placeto be preserved. So he made a magic trip or something and came here.\u201d\n\u201cKiamo Ko called to him and he couldn\u2019t resist her attractions-\u201c\n\u201cHe said we were isolated, and a stronghold,\u201d said Sarima, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t disagree! And what\ndid it mean to me to take another book? We just lugged it up here, and put it with the rest. I don\u2019t\neven know if I told anyone about it. Then he blessed me and left. He walked with an oak-thorn staff\nover the Locklimb Trail.\u201d\n\u201cCan you really say you thought the man who brought this here was a sorcerer?\u201d said Elphie.\n\u2018And that this book comes from-another world? Do you even believe in other worlds?\u201d\n\u201cI find it a great effort to believe in this one,\u201d said Sarima, \u201cyet it seems to be here, so why\nshould I trust my skepticism about other worlds? Don\u2019t you believe?\u201d\n\u201cI tried to, as a child,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cI made an effort. The mothy, gormless, indistinct sunrise of\nsalvation world-the Other Land-I couldn\u2019t get it, I couldn\u2019t focus. Now I just think it\u2019s our own lives\nthat are hidden from us. The mystery-who is that person in the mirror-that\u2019s shocking and\nunfathomable enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cWell he was a very nice sorcerer, or madman, or whatever.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it was some agent loyal to the Ozma Regent,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cSecreting some ancient\nLurlinist tract here. Anticipating a revival of royalism, a Palace coup, worried about the kidnapped,\nsleep-charmed Ozma Tippetarius, coming in disguise to hide this document far away, but still\nretrievable\n\u201cYou are full of conspiracy theories,\u201d said Sarima. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that about you. This was an\nelderly gentleman, very elderly. And he spoke with an accent. He surely was a wandering magician\nfrom some other place. And hasn\u2019t he been right? The thing has sat here, forgotten, for what, ten\nyears or more already.\u201d\n\u201cMay I take it and look at it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. He never said not to read it,\u201d said Sarima. \u2018At the time I perhaps couldn\u2019t read at\nall-I forget: But look at that beautiful angel there! Do you really mean to say you don\u2019t believe in the\nOther Land? In an afterlife?\u201d\n\u201cJust what we need.\u201d Elphaba snorted as she picked up the tome. \u2018A post Vale-of-Tears Valeof-Tears.\u201d\nOne morning, after Six had tried and given up once again at some sort of lessons for the\nchildren, Irji suggested an indoor game of hide-and-seek. They drew straws and Nor lost, so she hid\n\n\fher eyes and counted. When she got bored with waiting she called out \u201cOne hundred!\u201d and looked\nabout.\nShe tagged Liir first. Though he liked to disappear alone for hours at a time, he was bad at\nhiding when it was required of him. So they hunted together for the older boys, and found Irji in\nSarima\u2019s Solar, crouching behind the velvet ruffles suspended from the perch of a stuffed gryphon.\nBut Manek, the best at hiding, couldn\u2019t be found. Not in the kitchen, the music room, the towers.\nRunning out of ideas, the children even dared to go down into the musty basement.\n\u201cThere\u2019s tunnels from here all the way to hell,\u201d said Irji.\n\u201cWhere? Why?\u201d said Nor, and Liir echoed.\n\u201cThey\u2019re hidden. I don\u2019t know where. But everybody says so. Ask Six. I think because this used\nto be a waterworks headquarters-it did. Hell burns so hot they need water, and the devils tunneled up\nto here.\u201d\nNor said, \u201cLook, Liir, here\u2019s the fishwell.\u201d\nIn the center of a low-vaulted room, damp with moisture beaded up on its stone walls, stood a\nlow well with a wooden lid. There was a simple device with a chain and a stone for shifting the lid\nsideways. It was child\u2019s play to uncover the shaft.\n\u201cDown there,\u201d said Irji, \u201cis where we get the fish we eat. Nobody knows if there\u2019s a whole\nlake down there or if it\u2019s bottomless, or if you can go down right to hell.\u201d He moved the rushlight\nabout, and there was a round of black water shining back a reflection, in chips and circles of chilly\nwhite light.\n\u201cSix says there\u2019s a gold carp in there,\u201d said Nor. \u201cShe saw it once. Biggest old thing, she\nthought it was a floating brass kettle bobbing to the surface, and then it turned and looked at her.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it was a brass kettle,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cKettles don\u2019t have eyes,\u201d said Nor.\n\u2018Anyway, Manek\u2019s not here,\u201d said Irji. \u201cIs he?\u201d He called, \u201cHello, Manek,\u201d and the echo rolled\nand dissolved in the wet dark.\n\u201cMaybe Manek went down to hell in one of those tunnels,\u201d said Liir.\nIrji swung the lid back on the fishwell. \u201cBut you\u2019re it, Nor, I\u2019m not going to look down here\nanymore.\u201d\nThey gave themselves the creeps, and raced back upstairs. Four yelled at them for making too\nmuch noise.\nNor found Manek at last on the stairs outside the door to Auntie Guest\u2019s rooms. \u201cShhh,\u201d he said\nas they came near, and Nor tapped him anyway, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re out.\u201d\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he said again, more urgently.\nThey took turns looking through the crack in the weathered grain of the door.\nAuntie had her finger in a book, and she was mumbling things to herself, sounding them out this\nway and that. On the dresser next to her squatted Chistery, in an uneasy, obedient silence.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d said Nor.\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to teach him to talk,\u201d said Manek.\n\u201cLet me look,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cSay spirit,\u201d said Auntie in a kind voice. \u201cSay spirit. Spirit. Spirit.\u201d\nChistery twisted his mouth to one side, as if considering it.\n\u201cThere is no difference,\u201d said Auntie to herself, or maybe to Chistery. \u201cThe strands are the\nsame, the skeins are the same; the rock remembers; the water has memory; the air has a past for\nwhich it can be held accountable; the flame renews itself like a pfenix. What is an animal, but made\nof rock and water and fire and ether! Remember how to speak, Chistery. You are animal, but Animal\nis your cousin, damn you. Say spirit.\u201d\n\n\fChistery picked a nit off his chest and ate it.\n\u201cSpirit,\u201d sang Auntie, \u201cthere is spirit, I know it. Spirit!\u201d\n\u201cSpit,\u201d said Chistery, or something like it.\nIrji shoved Manek aside and the children almost fell through the door trying to see Auntie laugh\nand dance and sing. She picked up Chistery and hugged him, and said, \u201cSpirit, oh spirit, Chistery!\nThere is spirit! Say spirit!\u201d\n\u201cSpit, spit, spit,\u201d said Chistery, unimpressed with himself. \u201cSpite.\u201d\nBut Killyjoy woke from a nap at the sound of a new voice.\n\u201cSpirit,\u201d said Auntie.\n\u201cSpeared,\u201d said Chistery patiently. \u201cSpared. Spored. Sput spot sput. Spat spate spit, speed\nspurt spot.\u201d\n\u201cSpirit,\u201d said Auntie, \u201coh, my Chistery, we\u2019ll find ourselves a link with Doctor Dillamond\u2019s\nold work yet! There is a universal design among us all, could we get in deeply enough to see!\nEverything is not In vain! Spirit, my friend, spirit!\u201d\n\u201cSport,\u201d said Chistery.\nThe children couldn\u2019t stop laughing. They clattered down the stairs and fell into the dormitory,\nand giggled into the bedclothes.\nThey didn\u2019t mention what they saw to Sarima or the sisters. They were afraid Auntie would be\nstopped, and they all wanted Chistery to learn enough language so that he could play with them.\nOne windless day, when it seemed they must get out of Kiamo Ko or expire of boredom, Sarima\nhad the idea that they go skating on a nearby pond. The sisters agreed, and dug out the rusting skates\nFiyero had brought back from the Emerald City. The sisters baked caramel sweets and prepared\nflasks of cocoa, and even decorated themselves with green and gold ribbons, as if it were a second\nLurlinemas. Sarima adorned herself in a brown velvet robe with fur tippets, the children put on extra\ntrousers and tunics, and even Elphaba came along, in a thick cloak of purple brocade and heavy\nArjiki goatskin boots, and mittens, carrying her broom. Chistery lugged along a basket of dried\napricots. The sisters in sensible men\u2019s tribal overcoats, belted and latched, drew up the rear.\nThe villagers had cleared the snow off the center of the pond. It was a ballroom dance floor of\nsilver plate, engraved with the flourishes of a thousand arabesques, mounded round with pillows and\nbolsters of snow to provide a safe repose for skaters who forget how to brake or turn. In the fierce\nsunlight, the mountains looked razor sharp against the blue; great snowy egrets and ice griffons\nwheeled high above. The ice rink was already noisy with screaming urchins and lurching\nadolescents (taking every opportunity to tumble and heap each other cozily in suggestive positions).\nTheir elders moved more slowly, processionally around the\nice. The crowd fell silent as the household of Kiamo Ko approached, but, children being\nchildren, the silence didn\u2019t last for long.\nSarima ventured out onto the ice, her sisters in a knot around her with linked arms. Being\nlargish, Sarima was nervous of falling, nor were her ankles strong. But before long she had\nremembered how things went-this foot, then that, long languorous strides-and the uneasy meeting of\nsocial classes was accomplished. Elphaba looked like one of her crows: knees out, elbows flailing,\nrags flapping, gloved hands raking for balance.\nAfter the adults had had enough excitement (but the children were only still warming up) Sarima\nand the sisters and Elphie collapsed on some bearskins that the citizenry had spread out for them.\n\u201cIn the summer,\u201d said Sarima, \u201cwe have a huge bonfire and slaughter some pigs, before the men\ndescend to the plains, or the boys ascend to the slopes to guard the sheep and the goats. They all\ncome into the castle for a chew of pork and a few tankards of ale. And of course, any time there\u2019s a\nmountain lion or a particularly nasty bear, we let them into the keep until the beast is killed or\n\n\fwanders away.\u201d She smiled with noblesse oblige in an abbreviated way, off into the middle\ndistance, though the locals were ignoring the castle folk by now. \u2018Auntie dear, you looked quite the\nsight in that robe, and poking along with that broom.\u201d\n\u201cLiir says it\u2019s a magic broom,\u201d said Nor, who had run up to throw a handful of granular\nsnowflakes into her mother\u2019s face. Elphaba turned her head quickly and tugged her collar up to avoid\nricocheting snow spray. Nor laughed unkindly in a beautiful phrase like a woodwind, and scampered\naway.\n\u201cSo tell us how your broom came to be magic,\u201d said Sarima.\n\u201cI never said it was magic. I got it from an elderly maunt named Mother Yaclde. She took me\nunder her wing, when she was alert enough, and gave me-well, guidance, I suppose you\u2019d call it.\u201d\n\u201cGuidance,\u201d said Sarima.\n\u201cThe old maunt said the broom would be my link to my destiny,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cI assume she\nmeant that my destiny was domestic. Not magic.\u201d\n\u201cJoin the sisterhood.\u201d Sarima yawned.\n\u201cI never knew if Mother Yackle was completely mad or a wise, prophetic old hen,\u201d said\nElphie, but the others weren\u2019t listening, so she lapsed into silence.\nAfter a while Nor came flinging herself into her mother\u2019s lap again. \u201cTell me a story, Mama,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThose boys are nasty.\u201d\n\u201cBoys are vexing creatures,\u201d agreed her mother. \u201cSometimes. Shall I tell you the story of when\nyou were born?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not that,\u201d said Nor, yawning. \u2018A real story. Tell me about the Witch and the fox babies\nagain.\u201d\nSarima protested, knowing full well that the children considered Auntie Guest a witch. But Nor\nwas stubborn and Sarima relented, and told the tale. Elphaba listened. Her father had taught her\nmoral precepts, had lectured her about responsibility; Nanny had gossiped; Nessarose had whined.\nBut no one had told stories to her when she was young. She pulled herself forward a little so she\ncould hear over the noise of the crowd.\nSarima recited the tale with little dramatic involvement, but even so, Elphaba felt a twinge\nwhen she heard the conclusion. \u2018And there the wicked old Witch stayed, for a good long time.\u201d\n\u201cDid she ever come out?\u201d recited Nor, eyes gleaming with the fun of the ritual.\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d answered Sarima, and leaned forward, pretending to bite Nor on the neck. Nor\nsquealed and jiggled herself away, and ran to rejoin the boys.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s shameful, even if it\u2019s just a story, to propose an afterlife for evil,\u201d said Elphaba.\n\u201cAny afterlife notion is a manipulation and a sop. It\u2019s shameful the way the unionists and the pagans\nboth keep talking up hell for intimidation and the airy Other Land for reward.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Sarima said. \u201cFor one thing, that\u2019s where Fiyero is waiting for me. And you know it.\u201d\nElphaba\u2019s jaw dropped. When she least expected it, Sarima always seemed ready to rush in\nwith a surprise attack. \u201cIn the afterlife?\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cOh, what you do take against,\u201d said Sarima. \u201cI pity the community of the afterlife when they\u2019re\nasked to welcomeyou in. What a sour apple you always are.\u201d\nShe\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Manek knowledgeably. \u201cEveryone knows that you can\u2019t teach an animal to\ntalk.\u201d\nThey were in the abandoned summer stable, jumping off a loft, making puffs of hay and snow\nbillow in the patchy light.\n\u201cWell, what is she doing with Chistery then?\u201d asked Irji. \u201cIf you\u2019re so sure of it?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s teaching him to mimic, like a parrot,\u201d said Manek.\n\u201cI think she\u2019s magic,\u201d said Nor.\n\n\f\u201cYou, you think everything\u2019s magic,\u201d Manek said. \u201cStupid girl.\u201d\n\u201cWell, everything is,\u201d said Nor, launching herself away from the boys as a further editorial\ncomment on their skepticism.\n\u201cDo you really think she\u2019s magic?\u201d said Manek to Liir. \u201cYou know her better than any of us.\nShe\u2019s your mother.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s my Auntie, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Liir said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s our Auntie, she\u2019syour mother.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Irji, pretending full immersion in the topic to avoid another jump. \u201cLiir is\nChistery\u2019s brother. Liir is what Chistery was like before she taught him how to talk. You\u2019re a\nmonkey, Liir.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a monkey,\u201d said Liir, \u201cand I\u2019m not magicked.\u201d\n\u201cVv\u2019ell, let\u2019s go ask Chistery,\u201d said Manek. \u201cIs this the day that Auntie has her coffee with\nMama? Let\u2019s go see if Chistery has learned enough words to answer some questions.\u201d\nThey scampered up the stone spiral staircase to Auntie Witch\u2019s apartment.\nTrue, she was gone, and there was Chistery nibbling on some nutshells, and KIllyjoy dozing by\nthe fire, growling in his sleep, and the bees doing their ceaseless chorus. The children didn\u2019t like\nbees much, nor did they care for Killyjoy. Even Liir had lost interest in the dog once he had children\nto play with. But Chistery was a favorite. \u201cSweet thing, oh the little baby,\u201d said Nor. \u201cHere, you\nlittle beast, come to Auntie Nor.\u201d The monkey looked doubtful, but then on knuckles and capable feet\nhe swung across the floor and vaulted into her arms. He inspected her ears for treats, peered over\nher shoulders at the boys.\n\u201cYou tell us, Chistery boy, is Auntie Witch really magic?\u201d said Npr. \u201cTell us all about Auntie\nWitch.\u201d\n\u201cWatch Witch,\u201d said Chistery, playing with his fingers. \u201cWhich wretch which?\u201d They could\nhave sworn it was a question, the way his forehead wrinkled like eyebrows.\nlire you unaer a spell?\u201d saia Manek.\n\u201cSpell ill. Spoil spell,\u201d answered Chistery. \u201cSpill all.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we spoil the spell? How do we turn you back to a boy?\u201d asked Irji, the oldest but just\nas caught up as the others. \u201cIs there a special way?\u201d\n\u201cWhy way?\u201d said Chistery. \u201cWe woo, we weigh woe. Why?\u201d\n\u201cTell us what to do,\u201d said Nor, petting him.\n\u201cDo, die,\u201d said Chistery.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Irji. \u201cSo we can\u2019t break the spell you\u2019re under?\u201d\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s only babbling,\u201d Elphaba said from the doorway. \u201cLook, I have visitors I didn\u2019t even\ninvite.\u201d\n\u201cOh hello, Auntie,\u201d they said. They knew they shouldn\u2019t be there. \u201cHe\u2019s talking, sort of. He\u2019s\nmagicked.\u201d\n\u201cHe mostly just repeats what you say,\u201d said Elphaba, moving closer. \u201cSo leave him alone.\nYou\u2019re not allowed here.\u201d\nThey said, \u201cSorry,\u201d and left. Back in the boys\u2019 room, they fell on the mattress and roared until\nthey wept, and couldn\u2019t say what was so funny. Maybe it was the relief of having escaped without\nharm from the Witch\u2019s rooms, even though they had no business there. The children decided they\nwere no longer scared of Auntie Witch.\ney were tired of being housebound, but finally it was raining out\ninstead of snowing. They played hide-and-seek a lot, waiting for the rain to lift so they could go\noutside.\nOne morning, Nor was it. She kept finding Manek easily, because Liir always hid near him and\n\n\fgave him away. Manek lost his patience. \u201cI always get caught, because you\u2019re so hopeless. Why\ncan\u2019t you hide well?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI can\u2019t hide in the well,\u201d Liir said, misunderstanding.\n\u201cOh yes you can,\u201d Manek said, delighted.\nThe next round began, and Manek led Liir right down the basement steps. The basement was\neven damper than usual, with the groundwater seeping through the foundation stones. When they\nswiveled the lid off the fishwell, they could see the water level had risen. But it was still a good\ntwelve or fourteen feet down.\n\u201cThis\u2019ll just be fine,\u201d Manek said, \u201clook, if we loop the rope over this hook, the bucket will\nhold steady enough for you to climb in it. Then when I let the crank out, the bucket will slowly slide\ndown the side of the well. I\u2019ll stop it before it gets to the water, don\u2019t worry. Then I\u2019ll put the lid on\nand Nor will look and look! She\u2019ll never find you.\u201d\nLiir peered into the clammy shaft. \u201cWhat if there are spiders?\u201d\n\u201cSpiders hate water,\u201d said Manek authoritatively. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about spiders.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough to lower me, that\u2019s why,\u201d said Manek patiently.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hide far away,\u201d said Lift. \u201cDon\u2019t let me down too far. Don\u2019t push the cover on all the\nway, I don\u2019t like the dark.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always complaining,\u201d Manek said, giving him a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t like you,\nyou know.\u201d\n\u201cWell, everybody\u2019s mean to me,\u201d Liir said.\n\u201cCrouch down now. Hold on to the ropes with both hands. If the bucket scrapes against the wall\na little bit just push yourself away. I\u2019ll let it down slowly.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going to hide?\u201d Liir said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anyplace else in this room.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hide under the stairs. She\u2019ll never find me in the shadows, she hates spidcrs.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you said there weren\u2019t any spiders!\u201d\n\u201cShe thinks there are,\u201d Manek said. \u201cOne two three. This is really a good idea, Liir. You\u2019re so\nbrave.\u201d He grunted with the effort. Liir was heavier in the bucket than he had figured, and the rope\nspooled too quickly. It jammed in the joint between the windlass and the struts, and the bucket\nstopped and smashed against the wall with an echoing thud.\n\u201cThat was too fast,\u201d came Liir\u2019s voice, ghostly in the gloom.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be a sissy,\u201d Manek said. \u201cNow shhh, I\u2019m going to pivot the cover back on partway,\nso she won\u2019t guess. Don\u2019t make any noise.\u201d\n\u201cI think there\u2019s fish down here.\u201d\n\u201cOf course there are, it\u2019s a fishwell.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m awfully near the water. Do they jump?\u201d\n\u201cYes they jump, and they have sharp teeth, you ninny, and they like\nfat little boys,\u201d said Manek. \u201cOf course they don\u2019t jump. Would I put you in danger like that if\nthey did? Honestly, you don\u2019t trust me at all, do you?\u201d He sighed, as if disappointed beyond words,\nand when the cover slid all the way on instead of part way, he noted without surprise that Liir was\ntoo hurt to complain.\nManek hid under the stairs for a little while. When Nor didn\u2019t come down he decided that\nbehind the altar skirts of the old musty chapel would be an even better hiding place. \u201cBe right back,\nLiir,\u201d he hissed, but since Liir didn\u2019t answer Manek guessed he was still nursing his grievances.\nSarima was taking a rare turn in the kitchen, concocting a stew out of limp vegetables from the\nkeeping room. The sisters were having a dance recital amongst themselves in the music room\noverhead. \u201cSounds like a herd of elephants,\u201d Sarima said, when Auntie Guest came wandering\nthrough, looking for something to snack on.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cYou know, I have a complaint to lodge against\n\n\fyour children.\u201d\n\u201cThe sweet little vandals, what now,\u201d Sarima said, stirring. \u201cHave they been putting spiders in\nyour bedsheets again?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind spiders. At least the crows could eat them. No, Sarima, the children rifle\nthrough my belongings, they tease Chistery unmercifully, and they will not listen when I talk to them.\nCan\u2019t you do anything with them?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done?\u201d said Sarima. \u201cHere, taste this rutabaga, is it gone to the dogs?\u201d\n\u201cEven Killyjoy wouldn\u2019t touch this,\u201d decided Elphie. \u201cYou better stick with the carrots. I think\nthose children are ungovernable, Sarima. Oughtn\u2019t they be off to school?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, in a better life they would be, but how can they?\u201d said their mother placidly. \u201cI\u2019ve\nalready told you that they\u2019re sitting targets for ambitious Aijiki tribesmen. It\u2019s bad enough even to let\nthem run around on the slopes near Kiamo Ko in the summer, I never know when they\u2019re going to be\nfound, trussed, and bled like a pig, and brought home for burying. It\u2019s the cost of widowhood,\nAuntie; we must do the best we can.\u201d\n\u201cI was a good child,\u201d Elphie said stoutly. \u201cI took care of my little sis\nter, who was horribly disfigured from birth: I obeyed my father, and my mother until she died. I\ntramped around as a missionary child and gave testimonials to the Unnamed God even though I was\nessentially faithless. I believed in obedience, and I don\u2019t believe it hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cThen what did hurt you?\u201d asked Sarima wittily.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t listen,\u201d said Elphie, \u201cso I won\u2019t even say. But for whatever reasons, your children\nare ungovernable. I disapprove of your lax ways.\u201d\n\u201cOh, children are good at heart,\u201d Sarima said, intent on scraping carrots. \u201cThey are so innocent\nand gay. It cheers me up to see them dashing about the house in this game or that. All too soon these\nprecious days will be past, dear Auntie, and then we will look back on when this house was filled\nwith peals of childish laughter.\u201d\n\u201cFiendish laughter.\u201d\n\u201cThere is something inherently good about children,\u201d said Sarima decidedly, warming to the\nsubject. \u201cYou know that little Ozma, who all those years ago was deposed by the Wizard? They say\nthat she is off someplace, frozen in a cave-perhaps even in the Kells, for all I know. She\u2019s preserved\nin her childhood innocence because the Wizard hasn\u2019t the courage to kill her. One day she\u2019ll come\nback to rule Oz, and she\u2019ll be the best and wisest sovereign we ever had, because of the wisdom of\nyouth.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never believed in child saviors,\u201d Elphaba said. \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, children are the\nones who need saving.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just cross because the children have such high spirits.\u201d\n\u201cYour children are evil sprites,\u201d Elphie said, in a snit.\n\u201cMy children aren\u2019t evil, nor were my sisters and I evil children.\u201d\n\u201cYour children aren\u2019t good,\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cWell, how do you judge Liir in this regard, then?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Liir,\u201d Elphie said, and made an expression, and said pfaaaah, with her tongue and hands.\nSarima was about to pursue this-a matter she had long been curious about-when Three came rushing\ninto the kitchen.\n\u201cThe passes below us must have melted sooner than usual,\u201d she said, \u201cfor we have sighted a\ncaravan struggling its way over the Locklimb Trail, coming from the north! It\u2019ll be here by\ntomorrow!\u201d\nIt was lunchtime when the skarks and the wagon began the final, difficult ascent up the slope to\nthe castle portcullis and the gates of jasper and oak. The townspeople came out from their hovels and\n\n\fleaned their weight against the carriage, helping it through the ruts of mud and ice, until at last it\nturned in and crossed the open drawbridge. Elphaba, her curiosity as piqued as anyone else\u2019s, stood\nwith the Dowager Princess of the Aijikis and her sisters on a parapet above the crudely carved front\ndoorway. The children waited in the cobblestoned yard below, all but Liir.\nThe leader, a grizzed young man, made the faintest mountain obeisance to Sarima. The skarks\ndefecated sloppily on the cobbles, to the delight of the children, who had never seen skark fewmets\nbefore. Then\n\u201cOh, rapture,\u201d Sarima said, \u201cand the castle such a mess! This always happens. Why don\u2019t we\nlearn? Quick, call the children and we\u2019ll have to organize a scrub and polish. You never know,\nAuntie, it could be an honored guest. You have to be prepared.\u201d\nManek and Nor and liji came running from their game. Three told them the news, and they\nimmediately had to dash up the highest tower to see what they could see through the slackening rain,\nand to wave aprons and handkerchiefs. Yes, there was a caravan, five or six skarks and a small\nwagon, pulling through the snow and the mud, having trouble fording this stream, stopping to mend a\nsplit wheel, stopping to feed the skarks! It was a wonderful treat, and all through the dinner meal of\nvegetable soup the children chattered away at the surprises they might find among the passengers in\nthe caravan. \u201cThey\u2019ve never stopped thinking their father is going to come back,\u201d said Sarima under\nher breath to Elphaba. \u201cThis excitement is a hope for him, though they don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is Liir?\u201d asked Four, \u201cit\u2019s a perfect waste of good soup when he doesn\u2019t show up on\ntime. He shan\u2019t get any if he comes whining to me afterward. Children, where is Liir?\u201d\n\u201cHe was playing with us earlier. Maybe he fell asleep,\u201d said Irji.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go set a bonfire and smoke the travelers a hello,\u201d said Manek, leaping from the table.\nthe leader went to the cabin and opened the door, and climbed inside. They could hear his\nvoice, raised loudly as if talking to someone hard of hearing.\nThey waited. The sky was a piercing blue, really almost a spring blue, and the icicles hung from\nthe eaves in dangerous daggers, melting like mad. The sisters all sucked in their stomachs, cursing\nthe extra piece of gingerbread, the honeyed cream in the coffee, vowing to do better. Please, sweet\nLurlina, let it be a i-nan.\nThe leader came out again, and proffered a hand, and he helped a figure alight from the cabin:\nan old, creaky-limbed figure, in sad dark skirts and a hideously out-fashioned bonnet, even from the\nprovincial point of view.\nBut Elphaba was leaning forward, cleaving the air with her sharp chin and hatchet nose, and\nsniffing like a beast. The visitor turned and the sun struck her face.\n\u201cGood glory,\u201d breathed Elphie. \u201cIt\u2019s my old Nanny!\u201d And she left the parapet to run and gather\nthe old woman in her arms.\n\u201cHuman feeling, will you look at that,\u201d said Four, snify. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed her capable.\u201d\nFor Auntie Guest was all but sobbing with pleasure.\nThe caravan leader wouldn\u2019t stay for a meal, but Nanny with her valises and trunks clearly did\nnot intend to go any farther. She settled in a small musty room just below Elphaba\u2019s, and took the\nendless time it takes the elderly to make her toilet. By the time she was ready to be sociable, dinner\nwas served. A gamey old hen, more rope than flesh, lay in a thin pepper sauce on one of the good\nsalvers. The children were dressed in their best, and allowed this once to dine in the formal hall.\nNanny came in on the arm of Elphaba, and sat at her right hand. Because this was a visitor to Elphie,\nthe sisters had kindly put ElphIe\u2019s napkin ring at the foot of the table, opposite Sanma-a place by\ncustom left vacant, in honor of poor dead Fiyero. It was a big mistake, and they would recognize it\nalmost immediately, as Elphaba never relinquished her advancement. But for now all was smiles and\nsavory hospitality. The only small annoyance (besides that Nanny wasn\u2019t a young eligible princeling\n\n\flooking for a bride) was that Liir still conducted his campaign of sullen disappearance. The children\ndidn\u2019t know where he was.\nNanny was a tired and fruity old woman, skin cracked like dried soap, hair thin and yellowy\nwhite, hands with veins as prominent as the cords around a good Aijiki goat cheese. She\ncommunicated wheezily, with lots of pauses to breathe and think, that she had heard through someone\nnamed Crope, in the Emerald City, that her old charge Elphaba had attended Tibbett in his last days\nat the Cloister of Saint Glinda outside the Emerald City. No one in the family had heard from\nElphaba in years and years, and Nanny had decided to take it upon herself to find her. The maunts\nwere reluctant at first, but Nanny had persisted, and then she had waited until a new caravan was\nready to leave. The maunts had told her about Elphaba\u2019s mission in Kiamo Ku, and Nanny had\nbooked passage the following spring. And here she was.\n\u201cAnd of the outside world?\u201d asked Two eagerly. Let them catch up on family gossip on their\nown time.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Nanny.\n\u201cPolitics, science, fashion, the arts, the driving edge!\u201d said Two.\n\u201cWell, our redoubtable Wizard has crowned himself Emperor,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cDid you know\nthat?\u201d\nThey hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cBy whose authority?\u201d asked Five, scoffing, \u201cAnd furthermore, Emperor\nover what?\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone who has any more authority, he said,\u201d said Nanny calmly, \u201cand who could\nargue with that? He\u2019s in the business of handing out honors annually as it is. He just tacked on an\nextra one for himself. As for Emperor over what, I couldn\u2019t say. Some people whisper that this\nimplies expansionist aims. But where he could expand to-I couldn\u2019t say, I just couldn\u2019t. Into the\ndesert? Beyond, to Quox, or Ix, or Fliaan?\u201d\n\u201cOr does he mean to have a more tight-fisted hold on terrain he\u2019s only loosely governed,\u201d asked\nElphaba, \u201clike the Vinkus?\u201d She felt a chill, like an old wound deep beneath her breastbone.\n\u201cNo one is particularly happy,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cThere is an enforced conscription now, and the\nGale Force threatens to outnumber the Royal Army. One doesn\u2019t know if there could be an internal\nstruggle for power, and the Wizard is preparing against an eventual takeover attempt. How can one\nhave an opinion about such things? Old and female as we are?\u201d She smiled to include them all. The\nsisters and Sarima glared as youthfully as they could back at her.\nThe next day hardly dawned at all, so gloomy with rain, so glowery with featureless clouds.\nIn the parlor, waiting for Nanny to emerge and continue her obligation of entertaining them, the\nsisters and Sarima discussed what new facts they had learned about their Auntie Guest. \u201cElphaba,\u201d\nmused Two. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty enough name. Where does it come from?\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d said Five, who had once gone through a faintly religious phase when she\nrealized marriage possibilities were growing dim. \u201cI had a Lives of the Saints once. Saint Aelphaba\nof the Waterfall-she was a Munchkinlander mystic, six or seven centuries ago. Don\u2019t you remember?\nShe wanted to pray, but she was of such beauty that the local men kept pestering her for-attention.\u201d\nThey all sighed, in chorus.\n\u201cTo preserve her sanctity, she went into the wilderness with her holy scriptures and a single\nbunch of grapes. Wild beasts threatened her, and wild men hunted after her, and she was sore\ndistressed. Then she came upon a huge waterfall coursing off a cliff. She said, \u2018This is my cave,\u2019 and\ntook off all her clothes, and she walked right through the screen of pounding water. Beyond was a\ncavern hollowed out by the splashing water. She sat down there, and in the light that came through\nthe wall of water she read her holy book and pondered on spiritual matters. She ate a grape every\nnow and then. When at last she had finished her grapes, she emerged from the cave. Hundreds\n\n\fofyears had passed. There was a village built on the banks of the stream, and even a milldam nearby.\nThe villagers shrank in horror, for as children they had all played in the cavern behind the waterfalllovers had trysted there-murders and foul deeds had taken place there-treasure had been buried\nthere-and never had anyone ever seen Saint Aelphaba in her naked beauty. But all Saint Aelphaba\nhad to do was open her mouth and speak the old speech, and they all knew that it must be she, and\nthey built a chapel in her honor. She blessed the children and the elderly, and heard the confessions\nof the middle-aged, and healed some sick and fed some hungry, that sort of stuff, and then\ndisappeared behind the waterfall again with another bunch of grapes. I think a bigger bunch this time.\nAnd that\u2019s the last anyone has seen of her.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can disappear and not be dead,\u201d said Sarima, looking out the window a little dreamily,\npast the rain.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a saint,\u201d said Two pointedly.\n\u201cIf you even believe it,\u201d said Elphaba, who had come into the parlor during the end of the\nrecitation. \u201cThe reemerging Saint Aelphaba might have been some hussy from the next town over\nwho wanted to give gullible peasants a good going over.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s doubt for you, it scours hope out of everything,\u201d Sarima said dismissively. \u201cAuntie, you\nkill me sometimes, you really do.\u201d\n\u201cI think it would be charming to call you Elphaba,\u201d said Six, \u201cbecause that is a charming story.\nAnd it\u2019s nice to hear your real name on Nanny\u2019s lips.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you try it,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cIf Nanny can\u2019t help herselL so be it; she\u2019s ancient and it\u2019s hard\nto change. But not you.\u201d\nSix pursed her lips as if to make an argument, but just then there was a clattering of feet from\ndownstairs, and Nor and Irji burst into the room.\n\u201cWe found Liir!\u201d they said. \u201cCome on, we think he\u2019s dead! He\u2019s fallen in the fishwell!\u201d\nThey all pounded down the stairs to the basement. Chistery had been the one to find him. The\nsnow monkey\u2019s nose had wrinkled when he and the boys passed the fishwell, and he had whined,\nand whimpered, and tugged at the weighted cover. Nor and Itji had had an idea to lower him down in\nthe bucket then, but when they swiveled the cover off, the lurid gleam of light on pale human flesh\nhad terrified them.\nManek came running when he heard the noise of his mother and the others exclaiming before the\nwell. They pulled Liir up. The water had risen, what with continued melting and the further rain. Liir\nwas like a corpse left in a stream, bloated. \u201cOh, is that where he was,\u201d said Manek in a funny voice.\n\u201cYou know he said he wanted to go down in that fishwell once.\u201d\n\u201cGet away, children, you shouldn\u2019t see this, go upstairs,\u201d Sarima said, scolding. \u201cCome on\nnow, behave, upstairs for you.\u201d They didn\u2019t know what they were looking at and they were afraid to\nlook too closely.\n\u201cI cannot believe it, this is so terrible,\u201d said Manek excitedly, and Liphaba gave him a sharp,\nhateful look.\n\u201cObey your mother,\u201d she snapped, and Manek made a nasty face, but he and Irji and Nor\nclomped upstairs, and huddled around the open doorway at the top to listen, and peer.\n\u201cOh, who has the art of medicine in their hands, have you, Auntie?\u201d asked Sarima. \u201cQuick now,\nthere may be time. You have the arts, don\u2019t you, you studied the life sciences! What can you do?\u201d\n\u201cliii, go get Nanny, tell her it\u2019s an emergency,\u201d shouted Elphie. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring him up to the\nkitchen, gently now. No, Sarima, I don\u2019t know enough.\u201d\n\u201cUse your spells, use your magic!\u201d exclaimed Five.\n\u201cBring him back,\u201d urged Six, and Three added, \u201cYou can do it, don\u2019t be hidden and shy about it\nnow!\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI can\u2019t bring him back,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cI can\u2019t! I have no aptitude for sorcery! I never did!\nThat was all a foolish campaign of Madame Morrible\u2019s, which I rejected!\u201d The six sisters looked at\nher askance.\nIrji escorted Nanny to the kitchen, Nor brought the broom, Manek brought the Grimmerie, and\nthe sisters and Sarima brought the body of Liir, dripping and bloated, and laid him on the butcher\u2019s\nblock. \u201cOh, now who\u2019s this one,\u201d mused Nanny, but got to work pumping the legs and the arms, and\nset Sarima to pressing in at the abdomen.\nElphaba flipped through the Grimmerie, she screwed up her face and hit herself on the temple\nwith her fists, and wailed, \u201cBut I have no personal experience with a soul-how can I find his if I\ndon\u2019t know what one looks like?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s even fatter than usual,\u201d said Irji.\n\u201cIf you prick his eyes out with a magic straw from the magic broom, his soul will come back,\u201d\nsaid Manek.\n\u201cI wonder why he went in the fishwell?\u201d said Nor. \u201cI never would.\u201d\n\u201cHoly Lurlina, mercy on us, mercy!\u201d said Sarima, weeping, and the sisters began to mumble the\nservice of the dead, honoring the Unnamed God for the life departed.\n\u201cNanny can\u2019t do everything,\u201d snapped Nanny, \u201cElphaba, be some help! You\u2019re just like your\nmother in a Crisis! Put your mouth on his and push air into his lungs! Go on!\u201d\nElphaba wiped the wet off Liir\u2019s pasty face with the edge of her sleeve. The face stayed where\nit was pushed. She grimaced, and nearly\nvomited, and spit something into a bucket, and then she sank her mouth down on the child\u2019s, and\nbreathed out, pushing into the sour passage her own sour breath. Her fingers tensed at the sides of the\nbutcher\u2019s block, gouging splinters, as if in an ecstasy of sexual tension. Chistery breathed along with\nher, breath for breath.\n\u201cHe smells like fish,\u201d Nor said under her breath.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you look like when you drown, I\u2019d rather burn to death,\u201d said Iiji.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not going to die,\u201d Manek said, \u201cand nobody can make me.\u201d\nThe body of Liir began to choke. They thought at first it was an involuntary reaction, air from\nElphaba\u2019s mouth pocketing and blurting out again, and then there was a small stream of yellowish\nyuck. Then Liir\u2019s eyelids moved, and his hand twitched of its own accord.\n\u201cOh mercy,\u201d Sarima murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle. Thank you Lurlina! Bless you!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cHe may still die of exposure. Quick now, off\nwith his clothes.\u201d\nThe children watched the silly indignity of grown-up women tearing stupid Liir\u2019s trousers and\ntunic off. They rubbed him all over with lard. This gave the children a case of the giggles, and made\nliji feel very funny in his trousers, for the first time in his life. Then they wrapped Liir in a woolen\nblanket, which made quite a mess, and prepared to put him to bed.\n\u201cWhere does he sleep?\u201d said Sarima.\nThey all looked at one another. The sisters looked at Elphaba, and Elphaba looked at the\nchildren.\n\u201cOh, sometimes on the floor in our room, sometimes on the floor in Nor\u2019s,\u201d said Manek\n\u201cHe wants to sleep in my bed too but I push him out,\u201d said Nor. \u201cHe\u2019s too fat, there\u2019d be no\nroom for me and my dollies.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have a bed?\u201d Sarima coldly asked Elphie.\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t ask me, this is your house,\u201d said Elphie.\nAnd Liir stirred somewhat, and said, \u201cThe fish talked to me. I talked to the fish. The goldfish\ntalked to me. She said she was\n\n\f\u201cHush, little one,\u201d said Nanny, \u201ctime for that later.\u201d She glared around at the women and\nchildren in the kitchen. \u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t take Nanny to have to find him a proper bed, but if there\u2019s\nnone other\nfor him he can come up to my room, and I\u2019ll sleep on the floor!\u201d\n\u201cOf course not, the very idea,\u201d began Sarima, bustling ahead. \u201cBarbarians, the lot of you!\u201d\nsnapped Nanny.\nFor which no one In Kiamo Ko ever forgave her.\nSarima lectured Auntie Guest severely for what had happened to Liir. Elphaba tried to say that\nit was not her doing, it was not her fault. \u201cIt was some boys\u2019 trick, some game, some dare,\u201d she said.\nTheir accusations spent, they fell to talking about the differences between boys and girls.\nSarima told Auntie Guest what she knew of the boys\u2019 initiation rite in the tribe. \u201cThey are taken\nout in the grasslands, and left with nothing but a loincloth and a musical instrument. They are\nrequired to call forth spirits and animals out of the night, to converse with them, to learn from them,\nto soothe them if they need soothing, to fight them if they need fighting. The child who dies at night\nclearly lacks the discretion to decide if its company needs fighting, or soothing. So it is correct that\nhe should die young and not burden the tribe with his foolishness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do the boys say of spirits who approach them?\u201d asked Auntie Guest.\n\u201cBoys say very little, especially about the spirit world,\u201d she answered. \u201cNonetheless, you pick\nup what you pick up. And I think some of the spirits are very patient, very wearing, very obdurate.\nThe lore supposes there should be conflict, hostility, battle, but I wonder, in contact with spirits, if\nwhat the boy needs is a good helping of cold anger.\u201d\n\u201cCold anger?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, don\u2019t you know that distinction? Tribal mothers always tell their children that there\nare two kinds of anger: hot and cold. Boys and girls experience both, but as they grow up the angers\nseparate according to the sex. Boys need hot anger to survive. They need the inclination to fight, the\ndrive to sink the knife into the flesh, the energy and initiative of fury. It\u2019s a requirement of hunting, of\ndefense, of pride. Maybe of sex, too.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Elphaba, remembering.\nSarima blushed and looked unhappy, and continued. \u201cAnd girls need cold anger. They need the\ncold simmer, the ceaseless grudge, the talent to avoid forgiveness, the sidestepping of compromise.\nThey need to\nknow when they say something that they will never back down, ever, ever. It\u2019s the\ncompensation for a more limited scope in the world. Cross a man and you struggle, one of you wins,\nyou adjust and go on-or you lie there dead. Cross a woman and the universe is changed, once again,\nfor cold anger requires an eternal vigilance in all matters of slight and offense.\u201d She glared at\nElphaba, pinning her with unspoken accusations about Fiyero, about Liir.\nElphaba thought about this. She thought about hot anger and cold anger, and if it divided by the\nsexes, and which she felt, if either, if ever. She thought about her mother dying young, and her father\nwith his obsessions. She thought about the anger that Doctor Dillamond had had-an anger that drove\nhim to study and research. She thought about the anger that Madame Morrible could barely disguise,\nas she tried to seduce the college girls into the secret service of government.\nShe sat and thought about it the following morning as she watched the strengthening sun beat\ndown on the mounds of snow on the sloping tiled roofs below. She watched the sun bleed ice water\nout of the icicle. Warm and cold working together to make an icicle. Warm and cold anger working\ntogether to make a fury, a fury worthy enough to use as a weapon against the old things that still\nneeded fighting.\nIn a fashion-without any way to confirm It, of course-she had always felt as capable of hot\n\n\fanger as any man. But to be successful, one would need access to both sorts. .\nLift survived, but Manek did not. The icicle that Elphaba trained her gaze on, thinking on the\nweapons one needed to fight such abuse-it broke like a lance from the eaves, and drove whistling\ndownward, and caught him in the skull as he went out to find some new way of beleaguering Liir.\nThey\u2019re calling you a witch, do you know that?\u201d said Nanny. \u201cNow why ever is that?\u201d\n\u201cSilliness and stupidity,\u201d said Flphaba. \u201cWhen I arrived I was distanced from my name, after\nmy years at the mauntery, where I was called Sister Saint Aelphaba. Elphaba seemed like the name\nof someone long ago. I told them to call rue Auntie. Though I never felt like anyone\u2019s Auntie, nor\nwould I know what it felt like. I never had any aunts or uncles.\u201d\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re much of a witch. Your mother would be\nscandalized, bless her soul. Your father too.\u201d\nThey were walking in the apple orchard. A cloud of blossoms thickened the air with scent. The\nWitch\u2019s bees were having a field day, humming throatily. Killyjoy sat wagging his tail in the shadow\nof Manek\u2019s tombstone, placed near the wall. The crows had relay races overhead, scaring away all\nother birds except the eagles. Irji and Nor and Liir, at Nanny\u2019s insistence, had been taken into the\nschoolroom of the village. Kiamo Ko was blissfully quiet until midday.\nNanny was seventy-eight. She walked with a cane. She hadn\u2019t given up on her little efforts\ntoward beauty, though now they seemed to coarsen rather than dignify her. Her powder was on too\nthick, her lip rouge smeared and off center, and the flimsy lace shawl was useless in the updraft from\nthe valley. For her part, Nanny thought that Elphaba was looking poorly, as if she were going moldy\nfrom the inside out. Pale. A disintegration of sorts. Elphaba didn\u2019t seem to care for her beautiful hair\nat all, keeping it knotted up out of sight underneath that ridiculous hat. And the black gown needed a\ngood washing and airing.\nThey stopped at a lopsided wall, and leaned against it. The sisters were gathering flowers a\nfew fields away, and Sarima ballooned along. In her dark mourning gown she resembled a huge\ndangerous cocoon broken loose from its mooring. It was good to hear her laugh again, even if\nfalsely; light had that strange, ameliorative effect on everybody, even Elphaba.\nNanny had told Elphie about her family. The Eminent Thropp had died at last. In Elphaba\u2019s\nabsence and presumed death, the mantle of Eminence had fallen to Nessarose. So the younger sister\nwas now ensconced in Colwen Grounds, issuing dogmatIc statements about faith and blame. Frex\nwas there with her too, his career of ministry almost at an end. As he gave up the effort his mind was\nreturning to balance. Shell? He came and went. Rumors abounded that he was an agitator for\nMunchkinland\u2019s secession from Oz. He had grown up handsome and fine, in Nanny\u2019s biased opinion:\nstraight of limb, clear of skin, direct of speech, bold of heart. He was now in his early twenties.\n\u201cAnd what does Nessarose think of secession?\u201d Elphie had asked. \u201cHer opinion about it will\nbe important if she\u2019s the Eminent Thropp now.\u201d\nNanny reported that Nessarose had grown to be far cleverer than anyone anticipated. She kept\nher cards close to her chest and issued vague statements about the revolutionary cause, statements\nthat could be read several ways, depending on the audience. Nanny assumed Nessarose intended to\nset up some sort of theocracy, incorporating into the governing laws of Munchkinland her own\nrestrictive interpretation of unionism. \u201cYour sainted father Frex himself doesn\u2019t know if this would\nbe a good or bad thing, and keeps silent on the matter. He\u2019s not much for politics, he prefers the\nmystical realm.\u201d There was, Nanny observed, even some local support for Nessarose\u2019s plans. But\nsince Nessarose governed her remarks well, the Wizard\u2019s armed forces garrisoned in the area could\nfind no excuse to arrest her. \u201cShe\u2019s adept at this,\u201d Nanny admitted. \u201cShiz taught her well. She stands\non her own two feet now.\u201d\nThe word adept sent chills down Elphie\u2019s spine. Was Nessarose even now responding to some\n\n\fsort of spell that Madame Morrible had placed on her, those foggy years ago in the parlor at Crage\nHall? Was she in fact a pawn, an Adept of the Wizard, or of Madame Morrible? Did she know why\nshe did what she did? For that matter, was Elphaba herself merely a playing piece of a higher, evil\npower?\nThe recollection of Madame Morrible\u2019s proposals for their careers-hers, and Nessarose\u2019s, and\nGlinda\u2019s-had come back to Elphie with a shock following the recovery of Liir from his saturation\nand near drowning last winter. When he finally came around enough to answer questions about how\nhe had come to be in the fishwell, he could only say \u201cThe fish talked to me, she told me to come\ndown.\u201d Elphie knew in her heart that it was Manek, horrible evil Manek, who had tortured the boy\nunmercifully and openly all winter. She didn\u2019t care that Manek died, even if Manek was the precious\nson of Fiyero. Any torturer was fair game for javelin icicles. But she had to pause, gulping, at what\nLiir had said next. He said, \u201cThe fish told me she was magic. She said that Fiyero was my father, and\nthat Iiji and Manek and Nor are my brothers and my sister.\u201d\n\u201cGoldfish don\u2019t talk, sweetheart!\u201d Sarlma said. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining things. You were down there\ntoo long and your brain got waterlogged.\u201d\nElphaba had yearned toward Liir, a strange, unhappy compulsion. Who was this boy who lived\nin her life? Oh, she knew more or less where he came from, but who he was-it seemed to make a\ndifference, for the first time in her life. She had reached out and put her hand on his shoulder. He had\ntwitched it off; he was not used to such a gesture. And she had felt rebuffed.\n\u201cWant to see my pet mouse, Lift?\u201d said Nor, who had been warm to the boy during his\nconvalescence. Lift always chose the company of his peers over questioning by the grown-ups, and it\nwas impossible to pry further information out of him about his ordeal. He didn\u2019t seem much changed,\nexcept that with Manek dead, Liir charged around Kiamo Ko with greater zest and liberty.\nAnd Sarima had looked at Elphaba, and Elphaba thought the hour of her liberation was at hand\nat last. \u201cHow silly of the boy, he\u2019s delusional,\u201d Sarima had said at last. \u201cThe idea of Fiyero being\nhis father. Fiyero didn\u2019t have an ounce of fat on his body, and look at the boy.\u201d\nUnder the terms of her welcome, Elphaba could not prod Sarima to change her mind, but she\nstared at her hostess, willing her to accept the facts. But she wouldn\u2019t. \u201cAnd whoever might the\nmother be?\u201d said Sarima blandly, touching the hem of her skirt softly. \u201cIt\u2019s preposterous beyond\nwords.\u201d\nFor the first time, Elphie wished that Liir had at least an undertone of green in his skin.\nSarima had swept away, to weep in her chapel for her husband, for her second son.\nAnd the terms of Elphie\u2019s imprisonment-as an unwilling traitor, as an exiled maunt, as a hapless\nmother, as a failed insurrectionist, as a Witch in disguise-remained unchanged.\nThough the idea of a Goldfish or a Carp in the fishwell telling such things to LAir-was there any\npossibility in that? Or had Madame Morrible the ability to change her shape, to live in cold\ndarkness, to slip in and observe what Elphie was up to? Liir had no imaginatIon to speak of, he\ncouldn\u2019t have come up with that by himself. Could he?\nWhen she went to look in the fishwell, many times at all hours of the day or night, the old carpor Carp-stayed out of sight.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear Nessarose is on her two feet,\u201d said Elphaba at last, coming back to the\norchard from her musings. Nanny was gnawing at a piece of sugar candy.\n\u201cI mean that literally, you know,\u201d said Nanny through her spittle. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to be\npropped up anymore. Not figuratively or literally. She can stand on her own, stand and sit.\u201d\n\u201cWithout benefit of arms? I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to. Do you remember that pair of shoes that Frex had decorated for her?\u201d\nOf course Elphaba remembered! The beautiful shoes! Her father\u2019s sign of devotion to his\n\n\fsecond daughter, his desire to accentuate her beauty and draw attention away from her deformity.\n\u201cWell, old Glirida of the Arduennas, remember her? Married to Sir Chuifrey, and gone a bit to\nseed, in my humble opinion. She came to Colwen Grounds a couple of years ago. She and Nessarose\nhad a wild old time, remembering college days. And she put those very same shoes through\nsomething of an enchantment. Don\u2019t ask me. Magic was never my cup of tea. The shoes allowed\nNessarose to sit and stand and walk without support. She is never without them. She claims they give\nher moral virtue too, but then she has buckets more of that than she needs. You\u2019d be surprised how\nsuperstitious Munchkinlanders have become these days.\u201d Nanny sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was free to\nlook you up, deane.\nThe magic shoes made me redundant. Nanny is out of a job.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re too old to work, you sit and enjoy the sun,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cYou can stay here as long\nas you like.\u201d\n\u201cYou talk as if this is your house,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cAs if you have the right to issue such\ninvitations.\u201d\n\u201cUntil I\u2019m allowed to leave, this is my house,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d\nNanny shaded her eyes and looked out over the mountains, which in the midday light looked\nlike polished horn. \u201cIt\u2019s too rich, to think of you being a Witch, after a fashion anyway, and your\nsister trying out as resident Saint. Who would have thought, back in those muddy years in the\nQuadling badlands? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a Witch, whatever you say. But one thing I do want to know.\nIs Liir your son?\u201d\nElphaba shivered, though her heart, deep inside its pocket of cold, roiled in hot energy. \u201cIt is\nnot a question I can answer,\u201d she said sadly.\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t keep anything from me, deane. Remember, Nanny was nursemaid to your mother\ntoo, and a more outgoing, sensual woman I have yet to meet. Convention didn\u2019t bind her, not in youth\nnor in married life.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to hear about this,\u201d said Elphie.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s talk about Liir. What in blazes can you mean, you can\u2019t answer a simple question\nlike that? Either you conceived him and bore him, or you didn\u2019t. As far as I know in this world there\nare no other stories.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I mean,\u201d said Elphaba \u201cand the only remark about it I will ever make is this. When I first\nwent to the mauntery, under the kind offices of Mother Yackle, I was in no state to know what was\nhappening to me, and I spent about a year in a deathly sleep. It\u2019s just possible I brought a child to\nterm and delivered it. I was another full year recovering. When I was first assigned duties, I worked\nwith the sick and the dying, and also with abandoned children. I had no more congress with LAir\nthan with any other of several dozen brats. When I left the mauntery to come here, it was under the\ncondition that I would take Liir with me. I didn\u2019t question the instruction-one doesn\u2019t question the\ninstructions of superiors. I have no motherly warmth toward the boy\u201d-she gulped, in case this was no\nlonger true-\u201cand I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019ve ever gone through the experience of bearing a child. I don\u2019t\nquite believe myself\ncapable, in fact, although I\u2019m willing to concede that this may be simply ignorance and\nblindness. But that\u2019s all there is to say about it. I\u2019ll say no more, and no more will you.\u201d\n\u201cHave you an obligation to be motherly to him then, despite the mystery?\u201d\n\u201cThe only other obligations I\u2019m under are the ones I assign to myself And that, Nanny, is that.\u201d\n\u201cYou arc too tart, this situation makes you unhappy. But if you think I came here to raise yet\nanother generation of Thropps, forget it. Nanny is in her senility now, remember, and happily so.\u201d\nBut Elphaba couldn\u2019t help noting that in the weeks that followed, Nanny began to attend to\nLiir\u2019s needs more lovingly than she did the needs of Nor and Irji. Liphaba registered it with shame,\n\n\ffor she also saw how willingly Lift responded to Nanny\u2019s attention.\nIn telling tales of Shell\u2019s derring-do-her racy old heart pitter-pattering almost visibly beneath\nher breastbone-Nanny revealed details of the Wizard\u2019s campaigns. It made Elphaba furious, for she\nhad kept hoping to lose interest in the ways of evil men.\nNanny buzzed on about the Wizard\u2019s having mounted a new kind of youth camp, the Emperor\u2019s\nGarden-a pretty, euphemistic name. All Munchkinlander children from four to ten were required to\nattend, in month-long summer residencies. The children were sworn to secrecy-a great game for\nthem, no doubt. Nanny told a long-winded tale, more suited to toothless cronies in a fireside\ninglenook than to a dinner table with upright and repressed Arjiki spinsters, of how Shell, dear\nstranger brother Shell, disguised himself as a potato man doing deliveries. And got in the gates. Oh\nla, the many amusing adventures of a rake! The Camp General\u2019s nubile daughter in deshabille,\nShell\u2019s inventive alibis, his dalliances, his narrow escapes! Almost being discovered at his liaisonsby children! What a lark! Nanny remained a mouthy old peasant at heart despite her airs. Elphaba\nthought: She hardly comprehends she is talking about indoctrination, betrayal, forced conscription of\nchildren into lowlevel warfare. With Elphie\u2019s newfound awareness of Liir hovering at the edges of\nher life, bumbling gently through her days, she found these tales of indoctrinated children horrifying\nand repugnant.\nShe went to the Grimmerie and hauled open its massive cover- leather ornamented with golden\nhasps and pins, and tooled with silver leaf-and pored through the tome to find what makes people\nthirst for such authority and muscle. Is it the sheer nature of the beast within, the human animal inside\nthe Human Being?\nShe looked for a recipe for the overthrow of a regime. She found much on power, and damage,\nbut little on strategy.\nThe Grimmerie described poisoning the lips of goblets, charming the steps of a staircase to\nbuckle, agitating a monarch\u2019s favorite lapdog to make a fatal bite in an unwelcome direction. It\nsuggested the nocturnal insertion, through any convenient orifice, of a fiendish invention, a thread\nlike a piano wire, part tapeworm and part burning fuse, for a particularly painful demise. All of this\nseemed carnival sleight of hand to Elphaba. What was more interesting, in her reading, was a small\ndrawing she saw next to a section marked Evil Particulars. The drawing-done, if you would believe\ngullible Sarima, in some world other than theirs-was a clever sketch of a broad-faced woman-fiend.\nWritten in an angular, bronchiating script with elegant tapering serfs, all around the illustration, were\nthe words YAKAL SNARLING. Liphaba looked again. She saw a creature part woman, part\ngrassland jackal, its jaws open, its hand-paw lifted to rip the heart out of a spiderweb. And the\ncreature reminded her of old Mother Yackle from the mauntery.\nConspiracy theories, as Sarima had said, seemed to bedevil her thinking. She turned the page.\nNothing in the Grimmerie on how to depose a tyrant-nothing useful. Armies of holy angels were\nnot answerable to her. Nothing there that described why men and women could turn out so horrible.\nOr so wonderful-if that ever happened anymore.\nIn truth, the family was devastated over Manek\u2019s death. There was an unspoken feeling, that\nsomehow Liir\u2019s life had been saved at the expense of Manek\u2019s. The sisters suffered from that most\ndreadful of losses: the theft of the adult Manek from their lives. Their sad lot had been bearable all\nthese years because Manek was going to be the man\nFiyero had been, and maybe more. They realized in retrospect that they had expected Manek to\nrestore the fallen fortunes of Kiamo Ko.\nFeckless liji had no more sense of destiny than a prairie dog. And Nor was a girl, more ffighty\nand distractible than usual. So Sarima, behind her gestures of ecstatic acceptance of life (its joys, its\nsorrows, its mysteries, as she was fond of elaborating), became more aloof Never close to her\n\n\fsisters, she began to take her meals alone in the Solar.\nIrji and Nor, who had enjoyed a sort of allegiance from time to time against the headstrong\nmalice of Manek, had less to bind them together now. Irji began to moon about in the old unionist\nchapel, teaching himself to read better by scrutinizing moldy hymnals and breviaries. Nor didn\u2019t like\nthe chapel-she thought the ghost of Manek lingered there, as that was the last place she had seen his\nbody in the unwrapped shroud-so she tried to ingratiate herself with Auntie Witch-but to no avail.\n\u201cYou are out to make mischief with Chistery,\u201d snapped Elphie, \u201cand I\u2019ve work to do. Go bother\nsomeone else.\u201d She aimed a kick at Nor, who, whimpering and screaming as if it had hit home, left in\na funk.\nNor took to wandering-now that the summer was coming in- down the high valley, the one with\nthe stream at its bottom-and up the other side, where the sheep were nibbling on the best grass they\nwould get all year. In previous years she would either have been with her brothers, or she would\nhave been forbidden to go climbing alone. This year no one was paying enough attention to her to\nforbid it. She wouldn\u2019t have minded being forbidden, she wouldn\u2019t have minded the strap even. She\nwas lonely.\nOne day she wandered particularly far down the valley, luxuriating in the strength and\nendurance of her strong legs. She was only ten, but a strapping, mature ten. She had hiked her green\nskirt up into her belt, and because the sun was high and strong, she had shucked off her blouse and\ntied it like a bandanna around her head. She hardly had a swelling here or there on her chest with\nwhich to startle any sheep, and anyway she expected to be able to spot a shepherd from miles away.\nHow in the world did I come to be here, of all places in Oz, she asked herself, freshly treading\nupon the terrain of reflection. Here I am, a girl on a mountain, nothing but wind and sheep and grass\nlike an emerald brushfire, green and golden as Lurlinemas decorations, silky in the updraft, coarse in\nthe downdraft. Just me and the sun and the wind. And\nthat group of soldiers coming out from behind the rock.\nShe slid down onto her back in the grass, fixed up her blouse, and raised herself to her elbows,\nhiding.\nThey were not soldiers such as she had seen before. They were not Arjiki men in their\nceremonial brasses and helmets, with theft spears and shields. These were men in brown uniforms\nand caps, with muskets or something slung over their shoulders. They were wearing a kind of boot\nrather high and inappropriate for hill walking, and when one of them had stopped and was fiddling\nwith a nail or a stone in his boot, his arm dis appeared inside it right up to his elbow.\nThere was a green stripe down the front of their uniforms, and a bar across it, and Nor felt cold\nwith an unfamiliar sense of anticipation. At the same time she wanted to be seen. What would Manek\nhave done? she asked herself. Irji would run, Liir would puzzle and dither, but Manek? Manek\nwould have marched right up to them and found out what was going on.\nAnd so would she. She checked once again to make sure her buttons were done up, and then she\nstrode down the slope toward them. By the time she had got all their attention, and the man with the\nboot off had slipped It back on, she was beginning to rethink the wisdom of the plan. But it was too\nlate to run away now.\n\u201cHail,\u201d she said in a formal way, using the language of the east, not her own AijikI vernacular.\n\u201cHail, and halt. I am the Princess Daughter of the Arjikis, and this is my valley you are marching\nyour big black boots along.\u201d\nIt was broad noon when she delivered them into the castle keep of Kiamo Ko. The sisters were\nin their summer laundry yard, beating carpets themselves because they didn\u2019t trust the local\nscrubwives to treat them respectfully enough. The sound of boots on cobbles brought the sisters\nrunning through an archway, all flushed and dusty, hair wrapped in cotton scarves. Elphaba heard the\n\n\fnoise, too, and threw her window open and stared. \u201cNot an inch farther until I come down,\u201d she\ncalled, \u201cor I\u2019ll turn you all to rodents. Nor, come away from them. All of you, come away.\u201d\n\u201cI shall fetch the Dowager Princess,\u201d said Two, \u201cif it please you gentiemen.\u201d\nBut by the time Sarima arrived, drowsy from a nap, Elphaba had\ndescended, her broom over her shoulder, her eyebrows up to her scalp. \u201cYou have no invitation\nhere,\u201d said Elphie, looking more like a Witch than ever in her mauntish skirts, \u201cso just how welcome\nwould you like to be made? Who is in charge here? You? Who\u2019s the senior one leads this mission?\nYou?\u201d\n\u201cIf you please, Madame,\u201d said someone, a strapping Gillikinese man of about thirty. \u201cI am the\nCommander-the name is Cherrystone-and I\u2019m under the Emperor\u2019s orders to requisition a house\nlarge enough to shelter our party while we are in this district of the Kells. We are doing a survey of\nthe passes to the Thousand Year Grasslands.\u201d He produced a sweat-stained document from inside\nhis shirt.\n\u201cI found them, Auntie Witch,\u201d said Nor proudly.\n\u201cGo away. Go inside,\u201d said Elphaba to the girl. \u201cYou men aren\u2019t welcome here and the girl has\nno right to invite you. Turn around and march yourself out over that drawbridge at once.\u201d Nor\u2019s face\nfell.\n\u201cThis is not a request, it is an order,\u201d said Commander Cherrystone in an apologetic tone.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a suggestion, it\u2019s a warning,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cGo, or suffer the consequences.\u201d\nSarima by now had taken in enough to step forward, her sisters buzzing in a thrill around her.\n\u201cAuntie Guest,\u201d she said, \u201cyou forget the code of the mountains, the same code by which you came to\nlodge here, and your old Nanny after you. We do not turn visitors away. Please, sirs, excuse our\nexcitable friend. And excuse us. It has been some time since we saw soldiers in uniform.\u201d\nThe sisters were primping away as best they could at such short notice.\n\u201cI won\u2019t have it, Sarima,\u201d Elphaba said, \u201cyou\u2019ve never been out of here, you don\u2019t know who\nthese men are or what they will do! I won\u2019t have it, do you hear?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the high spirits, the determination, it makes her so much fun to have around,\u201d said Sarima a\ntrifle meanly, as in general she really did enjoy Elphaba\u2019s company. But she did not like having her\nauthority usurped. \u201cGentlemen, this way. I\u2019ll show you where you can wash up.\u201d\nIrji wasn\u2019t sure what to make of military men, and wouldn\u2019t go very near. Whether he was\nafraid of being conscripted or enchanted he couldn\u2019t say.\nHe dragged a sleeping roll down into the chapel and slept there, now that it was warm enough.\nIt was Nanny\u2019s opinion he was going weird. \u201cBelieve me, after a life looking after your dear\nmother\u2019s devout husband, Frex, and your sister after that, I know a religious lunatic when I see one,\u201d\nshe said to Elphaba. \u201cThat boy ought to be taking some lessons from these men in manliness,\nwhatever else is going on here.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Liir was in heaven. He followed Commander Cherrystone around unless he\nwas turned back, and he fetched water for the men and polished their boots, in a surfeit of illconcealed romance. The tramping they did, reconnoitering about the local valleys, mapping the\nplaces to ford the river, pinpointing spots for beacons, gave Liir more exercise and fresh air than he\nhad ever had before. His spine, which had threatened to become curved like the arc of a mountain\nharp, seemed to straighten out. The soldiers were indifferent to him, but they were not manifestly\nunkind, and LAir took this as approval and fondness.\nThe sisters regained some sense when they stopped to consider what class of men would go\ninto the army. But it wasn\u2019t easy.\nSarima alone seemed unperturbed by the disturbance to theft routine. She cast about among the\nvillagers and called in favors to help her feed the host of soldiers, and in mixed resentment and fear\n\n\fher neighbors came up with milk, eggs, cheese, and vegetables. There was stouch or garmot from the\nfishwell almost every evening. And the summer game, of course- quail, bill pfenix, baby roe-which\nthe men proved a dab hand at bringing in themselves. Nanny suspected that the reconnaissance team\nwas helping Sarima over her grief, bringing her back to the family table at least.\nBut Elphaba was furious at them all. She and the Commander had words every day. Elphie\nforbade him to allow Liir to tag along-and she forbade Liir himself-to absolutely no effect. Her first\ntrue motherly feelings were of incompetence and of being blithely ignored as inconsequential. She\ncould not understand how the human race had ever managed to develop past a single generation. She\ncontinually wanted to strangle Liir, as a means of saving him from smooth-talking father figures.\nAs Elphie tried harder to ferret out the nature of his mission, with every sidestepping pleasantry\nCommander Cherrystone grew more icy and polite. The one thing Elphaba had never been able to\nmanage was a parlor manner, and this soldier-of all people-was a master at it. It\nmade her feel as she had felt among the society girls at Crage Hall. \u201cPay those soldiers no\nmind, they\u2019ll go away eventually,\u201d said Nanny, who was at the time of her life when everything was\neither the final fatal crisis or a dismissible matter indeed.\n\u201cSarima says that she has rarely seen any of the Wizard\u2019s forces in the Vinkus. This was always\narid, lifeless, of little interest to the farmers and merchants of northern and eastern Oz. The tribes\nhave lived here for decades, centuries I suppose, with nothing but the occasional cartographer\npassing through and beating a quick retreat. Don\u2019t you think this suggests some sort of campaign in\nthese parts? What else can it suggest?\u201d\n\u201cLook at how long it has taken these young men to recuperate from their overland trek,\u201d said\nNanny. \u201cThis is surely just a reconnaissance mission, as they say. They\u2019ll get their information and\nthen leave. Besides, everyone is always telling me, the whole damn place is swamped in snow or\nmud for two thirds of the year. You\u2019re a worrier, you always were. The way you gripped the\nQuadlings we used to proselytize, as if they were your own private dolls! How you went on when\nthey were relocated or whatever! It used to trouble your mother no end, believe me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been well documented that the Quadlings were being exterminated, and we were\nwitnesses,\u201d said Elphaba strictly. \u201cYou too, Nanny.\u201d\n\u201cI look after my young, I can\u2019t look after the world,\u201d said Nanny, quaffing a cup of tea and\nscratching Killyjoy\u2019s nose. \u201cI look after Liir, which is more than you do.\u201d\nElphaba didn\u2019t think it worth her while to lambaste the old biddy. She ffipped through the\nGnmmerie again, trying to find some small spell of binding with which she could close the castle\ngates against the men. She wished she had at least sat in on Miss Greyling\u2019s class in magic at school.\n\u201cOf course your mother was worried about you, she always was,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cYou were such\nan odd little thing. And the trials that poor woman had! You remind me of her now, only you\u2019re more\nrigid than she was. She could really let her hair down. Do you know, she was so upset with having\nyou be a girl-she was so convinced you\u2019d be a boy-she sent me to the Emerald City to find an elixir\nto ensure But Nanny stopped, muddled. \u201cOr was that elixir to prevent her next child from being born\ngreen? Yes, that was it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did she want me to be a boy?\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI would have\nobliged her if I\u2019d had a say in the matter. Not to be simplistic, but it always made me feel\nhorrible, to know how I\u2019d disappointed her so early on. Not to mention the looks.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t credit her with nasty motives,\u201d said Nanny. She eased her shoes off and rubbed the\nbacks of her feet with her cane. \u201cMelena had hated her life at Colwen Grounds, you know. That\u2019s\nwhy she contrived to fall in love with Frex and get out of there. Her grandfather the Eminent Thropp\nhad made it all too clear that she would inherit the title. The Munchkinlander title descends through\nthe female line unless there are no daughters. The family seat, and all its attendant responsibilities,\n\n\fwould go from him, to Lady Partra, to Melena, and then to the first daughter Melena had. She was\nhoping to have only sons, to keep them out of that place.\u201d\n\u201cShe always talked about it so lovingly!\u201d said Elphaba, astounded.\n\u201cOh, everything is gorgeous once it\u2019s gone. But for a young person, trained up in all that wealth\nand responsibility-well, she hated it. She revolted by having sex early and often, with anyone who\nwould oblige, and she as good as ran off with Frex, who was the first suitor she had who loved her\nfor herself and not her position and inheritance. She thought a daughter of hers would find it equally\ndeadly, so she wanted sons.\u201d\n\u201cBut that makes no sense. If she had sons and no daughters, then her oldest son would inherit. If\nI\u2019d been a boy without sisters, I\u2019d still have been stuck in the same mess.\u201d\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cYour mother had one older sister, who was born with a\npermanent case of overwrought nerves, maybe also lacking in the brains department. She was housed\noff-grounds. But she was old enough to breed, and healthy enough, and was just as likely to bear a\ndaughter. If she had borne a daughter first, her daughter would have inherited the title of Eminence,\nand the estate and fortunes with it.\u201d\n\u201cSo I have a mad aunt,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cMaybe madness runs in the family. Where is she\nnow?\u201d\n\u201cDied of the flu when you were still a small child, and left no issue. So Melena\u2019s hopes were\ndashed. But that was her thinking, back in those brash, brave days of youthful blunder.\u201d\nElphaba had few memories of her mother, and they were warm, sometimes searing. \u201cBut what\u2019s\nthis about her taking medicine to prevent Nessarose from being born green?\u201d\n\u201cI got her some tablets in the Emerald City, from some gypsy woman,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cI explained\nto the beastly creature what had happened-I mean that you\u2019d been born an unfortunate color, and\nthose teeth-thank Lurline your second set were more human!-and the gypsy woman made some silly\nprophecy about two sisters being instrumental in the history of Oz. She gave me some powerful pills.\nI\u2019ve always wondered if the pills were the cause of Nessarose\u2019s affliction. I wouldn\u2019t mess with\ngypsy potions anymore, believe me. Not with what we know these days.\u201d She smiled, having long\nago forgiven herself of any culpability in the whole affair.\n\u201cNessarose\u2019s affliction,\u201d mused Elphaba. \u201cOur mother took some gypsy remedy, and bore a\nsecond daughter without arms. It was either green or armless. Mama didn\u2019t have very good luck at\ngirls, did she.\u201d\n\u201cShell, however, is a sight for sore eyes,\u201d said Nanny rosily. \u201cThen, who is to say it was all\nyour mother\u2019s fault? First there was the confusion about who was really Nessarose\u2019s father, and then\nthe pills from that old Yacide person, and your father\u2019s moodiness-\u201c\n\u201cYackle person? What do you mean?\u201d asked Elphaba, starting. \u201cAnd who the hell was\nNessarose\u2019s father if it wasn\u2019t Papa?\u201d\n\u201cOh la,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cpour me another cup of tea and I\u2019ll tell you all. You\u2019re old enough now,\nand Melena\u2019s long dead.\u201d She meandered through a story about the Quadling glassblower named\nTurtle Heart, and Melena\u2019s uncertainty whether Nessarose was his child or Frex\u2019s, and the visit to\nYackle, about whom she could remember nothing else but the name, the pills, and the prophecy, can\u2019t\npull teeth from a hen so stop trying. She didn\u2019t mention (and she never had) how depressed Melena\nbecame when Elphaba was born. There was no point.\nElphie listened to all this, impatient and annoyed. On the one hand she wanted to throw it out\nthe window: The past was immaterial. On the other, things fell into a slightly different order now.\nAnd that Yackle! Was the name just a coincidence? She was tempted to show Nanny the picture of\nYakal Snarling in the Grimmerie, but resisted. No sense alarming the old woman, or giving her the\nnighttime frights.\n\n\fSo the two women poured each other tea and restrained themselves from painful observations\nabout the past. But Elphaba began to fret about Nessarose. Perhaps Nessie didn\u2019t want the position\nof Eminence, and was\njust as incarcerated there as her older sister was here. Perhaps Elphaba owed her the chance of\nliberty. Yet how much really could you owe other people? Was it endless?\nNor was beside herself. In a short time her whole life had changed, so utterly. The world was\nmore magic than ever, but it seemed lodged inside her now, not outside. Her body was waiting to\nflame, to blossom, and no one seemed to care or to notice.\nLiir had become a water boy for the expeditionary soldiers. Irji spent his time composing long\ndevotional libretti in honor of Lurlina. In a state of uncertainty over the men in residence, the sisters\nremained confined to theft chambers by their own inclination, yet quivering with readiness should\nthings change. Nothing could change, as convention dictated, unless Sarima married again, and then\nthey would be free to court. Their domestic campaigns to throw Commander Cherrystone and Sarima\ntogether, however, met with no success. They redoubled their efforts. Three even approached Auntie\nWitch for a love potion from that magic encyclopedia. \u201cHah,\u201d said Elphaba, \u201cthat\u2019ll be the day,\u201d and\nthat was that about that.\nNor, bereft of companionship, took to hanging around the men\u2019s dormitory, trying to pitch in\nwith chores that Liir wasn\u2019t asked to do, that men didn\u2019t much care about. She hung out theft cloaks\nin the sun. She polished their buttons. She brought them flowers from the hills. She prepared a tray of\nsummer fruits and cheeses that seemed to please them, especially when she served them herself One\nyoung, dark, balding soldier with a captivating smile liked her to pop the orange segments right in his\nlips, and he sucked the juice from her fingers, to the mingled enjoyment and envy of the others. \u201cSit\non my lap,\u201d he said, \u201cand let me feed you.\u201d He offered her a strawberry, but she wouldn\u2019t sit on his\nlap-and she loved refusing.\nOne day she decided to treat them to a full-scale chamber cleaning. They were out doing an\ninventory of the vineyards on the lower slopes and would be gone all day. Nor arrayed herself with\nrags, yoked herself\nwith buckets, and since Auntie Witch was deep in conversation with Nanny about, it seemed,\nSarima, Nor swiped the Witch\u2019s broom, for its thicker brush and longer handle. She headed to the\nbarracks.\nShe couldn\u2019t read much, so she ignored the letters and maps that spilled from the leathern\nsatchels left carelessly slung over the back of a chair. She tidied the trunks, and swept, and in the\neffort raised a lot of dust, and felt warm.\nShe took off her blouse, and slung one of the men\u2019s rough capes over her sun-browned\nshoulders. It gave off such a heady aroma of maleness, even after its airing, that she nearly swooned.\nShe lay down on someone\u2019s pallet with the cape just slightly falling open, so that she could imagine\nfalling asleep and having the men return and see the beautiful line of flat skin that ran between her\nfresh new breasts. She considered pretending to fall asleep. But she knew she wouldn\u2019t do this. She\nsat up, dissatisfied with the possibilities, and reached out to grab the nearest thing-it happened to be\nthe broom-so she could whack something in frustration.\nThe broom was out of reach, but it lunged a little toward her. It came across the floor of its own\naccord. She saw it. The broom was magic.\nShe touched it, almost fearfully, as if she guessed it had intentions. It felt no different from an\nordinary broom. It merely moved, as if guided by the hand of an invisible spirit. \u201cWhat tree are you\nwhittled from, what field are you mown from?\u201d she asked it, almost tenderly, but she expected no\nanswer and she got none. The broom quivered, and elevated itself a little off the floor, as if waiting.\nThe cape had a hood on it, and she drew this up over her face. Then she hiked her summer skirt\n\n\fto her knees, and threw one leg over the broom, to ride it as a child rides a hobby horse.\nThe thing rose, tentatively, so she could keep her balance by trailing her toes on the floor,\ncorrecting, correcting-the center of gravity was high, and the span was so narrow. The top of the\nhandle tilted farther up, and she slid down the shaft until she was caught against the brush top, as if it\nwere a saddle of sorts. She held on tightly; her legs, especially in the upper thigh, felt as if they were\nswelling, the better to clench the handle between them. The large window at the end of the room hung\nopen, for aft and light, and the broom moved a couple of feet across the floor, until it had reached the\nsill.\nThen the broom rose a few feet, and carried her out the window. Nor\u2019s stomach pitched, and\nher heels beat against the underside of the brush. Mercifully she had emerged not in the castle\ncourtyard, where she would likely be seen, but on the other side, where the land did not fall away\nquite so far and fast. Nor wailed softly in the strangeness and ecstasy of the adventure. The cape\nflared out, exposing her chest, and how could she ever have imagined she wanted to be seen without\na blouse? \u201cOh oh,\u201d she cried, but whether to the broom or to some guardian spirit, she did not know.\nShe shuddered with exposure and shock, and the broom rose higher and higher, until it had come to a\nlevel with the uppermost window, which was in the Witch\u2019s tower.\nThe Witch and her nanny were watching, open-mouthed, with cups of tea halfway to their lips.\n\u201cYou come down from there at once,\u201d ordered the Witch. Nor didn\u2019t know if it was she who\nwas being addressed, or the broom. She had no reins to tug, no words of magic to wield. However\nthe broom, apparently chastened, turned back, descended, and made a somewhat clumsy landing on\nthe floor of the men\u2019s barracks. Nor flung herself off, weeping and shivering, and reclothed herself\nproperly. She didn\u2019t want to touch the broom again, but when she picked it up the life had gone out of\nit, and she carried it up to the Witch\u2019s apartments expecting a severe reprimand.\n\u201cWhat were you doing with my broom?\u201d barked the Witch.\n\u201cI was cleaning the soldiers\u2019 quarters,\u201d gabbled Nor. \u201cIt\u2019s such a mess, their papers all over,\ntheir clothes, their maps .\n\u201cKeep your hands off my things, you,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cWhat kinds of papers?\u201d\n\u201cPlans, maps, letters, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Nor, regaining her spunk, \u201cgo look for yourself. I\ndidn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d\nThe Witch took the broom and appeared to consider hitting Nor with it. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Nor.\nStay away from those men,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cStay away from them!\u201d She raised the broom like a\ntruncheon.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll hurt you as soon as spit at you. Stay away from them, I say. And stay away from me!\u201d\nElphaba remembered that the broom was given her by Mother Yackle. The young woman had\nseen the old maunt as crippled, senile, a bother,\nbut now Elphaba looked back and wondered if there was more to her than met the eye. Was that\nbroom magicked by Mother Yackle, with a vestige of some Kumbricial instinct? Or did Nor have a\npower developing in her, and did she bring it out in the senseless broom? Nor apparently was a\nfervid believer in magic; maybe the broom was waiting to be believed in. Would it fly for Elphaba,\ntoo?\nOne night when everyone else had retired, Elphaba brought the broom out to the courtyard. She\nfelt a little foolish, crouching down on the broom like a child on a hobbyhorse. \u201cCome on, fly, you\nfool thing,\u201d she muttered. The broom twitched back and forth in a naughty way, enough to raise welts\nin her inner thighs. \u201cI\u2019m not a blushing schoolgirl, stop that nonsense,\u201d said Elphaba. The broom rose\na foot and a half and then dumped Elphie on her rear end.\n\u201cI\u2019ll set you afire and that\u2019ll be the end of you,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI\u2019m too old for this sort of\nindignity.\u201d\n\n\fIt took five or six nights of trying before she managed even to hover six feet off the ground. She\nhad been useless in sorcery. Was she doomed to be useless at everything? It was a pleasure, finally,\nto scare the barn owls and bats senseless. And it was good to be abroad. When she had more\nconfidence, she wobbled far down the valley to the remains of the Ozma Regent\u2019s attempt at a dam;\nshe rested and hoped that she wouldn\u2019t have to walk back. She didn\u2019t. The broom was resistant to\nher intention, but she could always threaten it with fire.\nShe felt like a night angel.\nIn midsummer, an Aijiki trader came along with pots and spoons and spools of thread, and he\ncarried with him some letters left at an outpost farther north. Among them was a note from Frexapparently Nanny had told him of her intentions to hunt Elphaba down, and he wrote to the mauntery,\nwhich had forwarded the letter on to Kiamo Ko in the Vinkus. Frex wrote that Nessarose had\norchestrated a revolt, and that Munchkinland-or most of it anyway-had seceded from Oz, and set\nitself up as an independent state.\nNessarose as the Eminent Thropp had become the political head of state. Frex apparently\nthought this was Elphaba\u2019s birthright, and that she should come to Colwen Grounds and challenge\nher sister for it. \u201cIt may\nbe she isn\u2019t the right woman for the job,\u201d he wrote, though Elphaba found his apprehension\nsurprising. Wasn\u2019t Nessarose the warmly spin-tual daughter that Elphie could never be?\nElphaba had no thirst for leadership, and did not want to challenge Nessarose in any way. But\nnow that the broom seemed able to carry her for long distances, she wondered if she could fly by\nnight to Colwen Grounds, and spend a few days seeing Papa, Nessie, and Shell once again. It had\nbeen a dozen years since she left Nessie in Shiz, drunk and sobbing following the death of Ama\nClutch.\nFor Munchkinland to be free of the Wizard\u2019s iron grip!-that alone would be worth the trip. It\nmade Elphie grin a bit at herself, to feel her old contempt for the Wizard flare up. Perhaps this was\nwhat healing meant, after all.\nTo be safe, one afternoon Elphaba went through the soldiers\u2019 empty barracks. She pawed\nthrough their papers. All the documents related to issues of mapping and geological survey. Nothing\nelse. There seemed to be no hidden agenda of threat to the Arjikis or the other Vinkus tribes.\nThe earlier she went, the sooner she would return. And it would be better if no one know. So\nshe told everyone she was taking a period of isolation in her tower, and she wanted neither food nor\nvisitors for some days. When midnight struck, she set out for Coiwen Grounds, now the home of her\npowerful sister.\nShe slept by daylight in the shadows of barns, the overhang of eaves, the lee of chimneys. She\ntraveled by night. In the gloom, Oz spread out below-she hovered above it at about eighty feet, near\nas she could reckon-and the countryside made its geographical transformations with the ease of a\nvaudeville backdrop on rollers. The hardest passage was down the steep flanks of the Great Kells.\nOnce free of the mountairis, however, she saw Oz level out into the rich alluvial plain of the Gillikin\nRiver.\nShe flew along the waterway, above trading vessels and islands, until it fed at last into\nRestwater, Oz\u2019s largest lake. She kept to its southern edge, and took a whole night to traverse it, as it\nendlessly lapped in black\noily silk waves, into sedge and swamp. She had trouble finding the mouth of the Munchkin\nRiver, which drained into Restwater from the eastern direction. Once she did, though, it was easy to\nlocate the Yellow Brick Road. The farmland beyond grew even more lush. The effects of the\ndrought, so drastic in her childhood, had been eradicated, and dairy farms and small villages seemed\nto prosper, happy as a child\u2019s toy town set, cunning and cozy in the wrinkled, nappy land of arabic\n\n\fsoil and accommodating climate.\nThe farther east she went, however, the more torn up the highway became. Crowbars had pried\nout bricks, trees had been felled and brush walls erected. It looked as if a few of the smaller bridges\nhad been dynamIted. A safeguard against retaliation by the Wizard\u2019s army?\nSeven days after leaving her chambers at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba flew into the hamlet of Colwen\nGrounds, and slept under a green bay tree. When she awoke, she asked a merchant for the great\nhouse, and he tremblingly pointed her the way, as if she were a demon. So a green skin still gives\nMunchkinlanders the creeps, she observed, and walked the last couple of miles, and arrived at the\nfront gates of Colwen Grounds a little after breakfast.\nShe had heard her mother speak of Colwen Grounds, wistfully and angrily, as they had slopped\nin waterproof boots through six inches of Quadling Country water. Elphie\u2019s years in the smug\nantiquity of Shiz, and the pomp of the Emerald City, ought to have prepared her for an imposing\nmansion. But she was startled, even shocked, at the grandeur of Colwen Grounds.\nThe gate was gilded, the forecourt swept clean of every scrap of grass and dung, and a bank of\ntopiary saints in terra-cotta pots lined the balcony above the massive front door. Dignitaries with\nribbons denoting new rank and prestige in the Free State of Munchkinland, she guessed, stood in\nsmall groups to one side. Coffee cups in hand, the officials had apparently just finished an early\nmorning privy council meeting. Inside the gate, swordsmen stepped neatly up and barred her way.\nShe began to protest-instantly branded a menace and a loon, she could see-and she was about to be\nejected when a figure wandered into view from around the corner of a folly, and called for them to\nstop.\n\u201cFabala!\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, Papa, I\u2019m here,\u201d she answered, with a child\u2019s politeness.\nShe turned. The dignitaries paused in their discussions, and then resumed, as if realizing that\noverhearing this reunion would be the height of rudeness. The guards withdrew their barrier when\nFrex approached. His hair was thin and long and caught up by a rawhide implement, as it always had\nbeen. His beard was the color of cream and reached his waist when he took his hands away from it.\n\u201cThis is the sister of the Eminence of the East,\u201d said Frex, staring at Elphaba, \u201cand my oldest\ndaughter. Let her pass through, dear men, now and every time she approaches.\u201d He reached and\ncaught her hand, and turned his head as a bird might to see her through one capable eye. The other\neye, she realized, was dead.\n\u201cCome, we will greet each other in private, away from this attention,\u201d said Frex. \u201cMy word,\nFabala, you have become your mother in these long years!\u201d He linked his arm into hers, and they\nwent Into the building through a side door and found a small salon done up in saffron silks and plum\nvelvet cushions. The door closed behind them. Frex lowered himself cautiously to the sofa and\npatted the upholstery next to him. She sat down, wary, tired, astonished at the wealth of her own\nfeeling for him. She was full of need. But, she reminded herself, you\u2019re a grown woman.\n\u201cI knew you would come if I wrote,\u201d he said. \u201cFabala, I always knew that.\u201d He wrapped her in\nhis arms, stiffly. \u201cI may cry for a minute.\u201d When he was through, he asked her where she had gone,\nand what she had done, and why she had never come back.\n\u201cI was not sure there was a back to come to,\u201d she answered, realizing the truth of it as she\nspoke. \u201cWhen you finished converting a town, Papa, you moved on to new fields. Your home was in\nthe pasture of souls; mine never was. Besides, I had my own work to do.\u201d She added, a moment\nlater, in a low voice, \u201cOr I thought I did.\u201d\nShe mentioned her years in the Emerald City, but did not say why.\n\u201cAnd was Nanny right? Were you a maunt? I didn\u2019t raise you for such submission,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised. Such conformity and obedience-\u201c\n\n\f\u201cI was no more a maunt than I ever was a unionist,\u201d she chided him gently, \u201cbut I lived with the\nmaunts. They did good work, whatever the\nerror or inspiration of their beliefs. It was a time of recuperation from a difficult passage. And\nthen, last year, I went to the Vinkus, and I guess I\u2019ve made my home there, although for how long I\ncannot say.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you do?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you married?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a witch,\u201d she answered. He recoiled, peered through the working eye to see if she spoke in\njest.\n\u201cTell me about Nessie before I see her, and Shell,\u201d she said. \u201cYour letter sounded as if you\nthought she needed help. I\u2019ll do what I can in the short while I can be here.\u201d\nHe told her about her sister\u2019s rise to Eminence, and the secession in the late spring. \u201cYes, yes, I\nknow of it but not why,\u201d she said, prodding. So he described the burning of a grange where\nopposition meetings had been gathering, the reported rape of a couple of Munchkinlander maidens\nfollowing a cotillion of the Wizard\u2019s army garrisoned near Dragon Cupboard. He mentioned the\nMassacre at Far Applerue and the heavy taxation on farm crops. \u201cThe last straw,\u201d he said, \u201cas far as\nNessie was concerned, anyway, was the callow despoiling by the Wizard\u2019s soldiers of simple\ncountry meetinghouses.\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely last straw,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cIsn\u2019t the back room of a colliery as holy a place to pray\nas a meetinghouse? I mean, according to teaching?\u201d\n\u201cWell, teaching,\u201d said Frex. He shrugged; such distinctions were beyond him now. \u201cNessie was\nincensed, and communicated her outrage, and before she knew it the spark had been thrown out and\nthe tinder caught. Within a week of her firing off a furious letter to the Emperor Wizard himself-a\ndangerous and seditious act-the revolutionary fever had coalesced around her. It happened right here\nin the forecourt of Colwen Grounds. It was magnificent, and you\u2019d have guessed Nessie was\ngroomed for treason. She addressed the senior men among the farming communities both near and\nfar, and kept her religious agenda in check, sensibly, I think. So her appeal for their support was\noverwhelmingly answered. There was a unanimous approval for secession.\u201d\nPapa\u2019s gone pragmatic in his old age, Elphaba observed with some surprise.\n\u201cBut how did you slip through the border patrols?\u201d he asked. \u201cThings being what they arehotting up, as they say.\u201d\n\u201cI just flew right through, a little black bird at nighttime,\u201d she answered, smiling at him, and\ntouching his hand. It was glazed and mottled pink, like a lake lobster on the boil. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t\nknow, Papa, is why you called me here. What do you expect me to do?\u201d\n\u201cI had thought you might join your sister in her seat of authority,\u201d he said, with the simpleminded hope of one whose family has been too long apart. \u201cI know who you are, Fabala. I doubt you\nhave much changed over the years. I know your cunning and your conviction. I also know that Nessie\nis at the mercy of her religious voices, and she could slip and undo the terrible good she is helping to\ncreate right now by being a focal figure for resistance. If that happens, it will not go well for her.\u201d\nSo I am to be a whipping girl, thought Elphaba, I am to be a first line of defense. Her pleasure\nevaporated.\n\u201cAnd it will not go well for them, the eager supporters,\u201d Frex said, waving a hand to indicate\nmost of Munchkinland. His face sagged-his smile was an effort too, she thought coolly-and his\nshoulders fell. \u201cThey have had more than a generation of gentle dictatorship from our Glorious\nWizard scoundrel-oh, even I forget, we\u2019re now in the Free State of Munchkinland-these farmers\nsurely underestimate the size of the eventual retaliation. In fact, Shell has found from reliable sources\nthat the stockpiles of grain in the Emerald City are massive, and we can be left for some time without\nneeding to be overrun. Short of routing some divisions of soldiers across the border, and jailing\n\n\fsome drunken hooligans, this has been a most genteel disengagement so far. We are deluded into\nbelieving we are safe. I mean Nessie is deluded too, I think. You, I have always felt, had a clearer\nmind about you. You can help her prepare, you can provide the balance and the support.\u201d\n\u201cI always did that, Papa,\u201d she said. \u201cIn childhood and at college. Now I am told she can stand\nup for herself\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of my precious shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought them from a decrepit crone, and then I\nretooled them for Nessa with my own hands, using skills in glass and metal that I had once learned\nfrom Turtle Heart. I made them to give her a sense of beauty, but I didn\u2019t expect them to be enchanted\nby someone else. I am not sorry they are. But Nessa now thinks she needs no one, to help her stand or\nhelp her govern. She listens less than ever. In some ways I think those shoes are dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cI wish you had made them for me, Papa,\u201d she said in a quiet voice.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need them. You had your voice, your intensity, even your cruelty as your armor.\u201d\n\u201cMy cruelty!\u201d She reared back.\n\u201cOh, you were a fiendish little thing,\u201d said Frex, \u201cbut so what, children grow into and out of\nthemselves. You were a terror when you first were around other children. You only calmed down\nwhen we began to travel and you got to hold the baby. It was Nessarose who tamed you, you know.\nYou have her to thank; she was holy and blessed even from the day she was born. Even as an infant,\nshe soothed your wildness with her obvious need. You don\u2019t remember that, I suppose.\u201d\nElphie wasn\u2019t able to remember, she wasn\u2019t able to think about all that. Even the idea of being\ncruel was slipping from her. Instead, she was trying to feel fondness toward her father, despite the\nexhaustion of being commandeered to be a second lieutenant once again, in service of dear needy\nNessarose. She concentrated on her father\u2019s concern for the citizens of Munchkinland. Ever a\npastoral sensibility, his. Though rejecting his theology, she adored him for his commitment.\n\u201cI must hear more about Turtle Heart one day,\u201d she said in a light voice, \u201cbut now, I suppose I\nshould go greet my sister. And I will think about what you say, Papa. I can\u2019t imagine being part of a\ngovernmental troika, with you and Nessarose-or a committee, should Shell be involved too. But I\u2019ll\nsuspend judgment for a while. And Shell, Papa, how is he?\u201d\n\u201cBehind enemy lines, so they say,\u201d Frex answered as she got up to leave. \u201cHe is a foolhardy\nboy and will be among the first casualties, once this really gets going. He resembles you in some\nways.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone green?\u201d she asked, amused.\n\u201cHe\u2019s stubborn as sin stains,\u201d he answered.\nNessarose was secluded in an upstairs parlor, conducting her morning meditation. Frex saw that\nElphaba was given license to wander about the house and demesne. After all, in another\nconfiguration of events, Elphaba could have been (or could yet become) the Eminent Thropp, the\nEminence of the East, the nominated head of the Free State of Munchkinland. Frex watched his green\ndaughter amble down marble\n:orridors, dragging her broom like a charwoman, gazing at the ormolu, the damask, the fresh\nflowers, the servants in livery, the portraits. He felt, as always, a twinge of pain deep in his breast,\nfor the hidden and unknowable things that he had done wrong in raising her. But he was glad that she\nwas here at last.\nElphaba found her way into a private chapel at the end of a hail of poiished mahogany. It was\nbaroque rather than ancient, and it was in the midst of being redecorated. Nessarose must have\nordered the frescoes to be whitewashed; perhaps the succulent images would distract people from\ntheft meditative tasks. Elphie sat on a bench on the side, amidst buckets of limestone wash and\npaintbrushes and ladders. She did not pretend to pray, though she felt very uneasy about this whole\nthing. She trained her gaze, to focus her mind, on a huge section still boasting its images. It featured\n\n\fseveral rotund angels levitating with the aid of sizable wings. Theft garments bad been cut to\naccommodate the anatomical irregularity, she saw. They were rather full-bodied dames, but the\nwings weren\u2019t bulging with straining arteries nor snapping at the tip. The artist had considered the\noptimal length and breadth of wing required to hoist ample ladies aloft. The formula looked to be\nabout three times wing length to the length of arm, corrected perhaps to account for the portliness. If\nyou could sweep your way to the Other Land on wings, what about on a broom? she wondered. And\nrealized she must be very tired; usually she\u2019d cut off senseless speculation about unionist nonsense\nlike an afterlife, a Beyond, an Other Land.\nI should remember my lessons from that life sciences course, she thought. All the devastating\nborders of knowledge Doctor Dillamond was about to cross. I almost understood some of it. I could\nstitch wings onto Chistery. He could join me in flight. What a lark.\nShe rose and went to find her sister.\nNessarose was less surprised to see Elphaba than Elphie would have guessed. Perhaps, Elphie\nconsidered, it was because Nessa had become used to being the center of attention. Then again, she\nhad always been the center of attention. \u201cDarling Elphie,\u201d she said, looking up from a pair of\nidentical books some attendant had laid out, next to each other, so she could read four pages without\ncalling for someone to turn the page. \u201cGive us a kiss.\u201d\n\u201cOh there, then,\u201d Elphie said, obliging. \u201cHow are you, Nessie? You look fine.\u201d\nNessarose stood, in her beautiful shoes, and smiled brilliantly. \u201cThe grace of the Unnamed God\ngives me strength, as ever,\u201d she said.\nBut Elphaba could not be annoyed. \u201cYou have risen, and I don\u2019t just mean to your feet,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cHistory has chosen you for a role, and you\u2019ve accepted it. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t be proud,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cBut thank you, dear. I thought you\u2019d probably come.\nDid Father drag you here to take care of me?\u201d\n\u201cNo one dragged me here, but Papa did write.\u201d\n\u201cSo all those years in solitude, and political turmoil brings you out at last. Where were you?\u201d\n\u201cHere and there.\u201d\n\u201cYou know we thought you\u2019d died,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cDrape that shawl around my shoulders\nand fix it with a pin, will you, so I needn\u2019t call a maid? I mean that awful, awful time when you left\nme alone in 5hz. I am still furious with you about it, I just remembered.\u201d She curled her lip, prettily;\nElphaba was glad to see she possessed at least a residual sense of humor.\n\u201cWe were all young then, and perhaps I was wrong,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do you any lasting\nharm, anyway. At least not so I can see.\u201d\n\u201cI had to put up with Madame Morrible all by myself, for two more years. Glinda was a help\nfor a while, then she graduated and went on. Nanny was my salvation, but she was old even then.\nShe\u2019s gone on to you lately, hasn\u2019t she? Well, back then I felt horribly alone. Only my faith saw me\nthrough.\u201d\n\u201cWell, faith will do that,\u201d said Elphie, \u201cif you\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\u201cYou speak as one still living in the shadowland of doubt.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact I think we have more important things to discuss than the state of my soul or lack thereof\nYou have a revolution on your hands- sorry, I guess I\u2019ve gotten out of the habit!-and you\u2019re the\nresident commander general. Congratulations.\u201d\n\u201cOh, tiresome events of the distracting world, yes yes,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cLook, it\u2019s just\nbeautiful out there in the gardens. Let\u2019s go walk for a bit and get some air. You look green about the\ngills-\u201c\n\u201cAll right, I deserved that-\u201c\n\u201c-and there\u2019s plenty of time to go into diplomatic matters. I have a meeting in a little while, but\n\n\fthere\u2019s time for a stroll. You should get to know this place. Let me show it to you.\u201d\nElphaba could only get Nessarose\u2019s attention for small snatches of time. However dismissive\nof the demands of leadership, Nessarose was clearheaded about her schedule, and spent hours\npreparing for meetings.\nAnd at first the discussion was frivolous-family memories, school days. Elphie was impatient\nto get around to the meat of the matter here. But Nessarose wouldn\u2019t be rushed. Sometimes she let\nElphie sit in when she held audiences with citizens. Elphie wasn\u2019t entirely pleased with what she\nsaw.\nOne afternoon an old woman from some hamlet in the Corn Basket came in. She made\nobeisance in a most disgusting and obsequious manner, and Nessarose seemed to shine back at her\nwith glory. The woman complained that she had a maid who, having fallen in love with a\nwoodcutter, wanted to leave her service to get married. But the old woman had already given three\nsons to the new local militia for defense, and she and the maid were all the labor available to bring\nin the crops. If the maid ran off with her woodcutter, the crops would spoil and she would be ruined.\n\u201cAnd all for the sake of liberty,\u201d she concluded bitterly.\n\u201cWell, what do you want me to do about it?\u201d said the Eminence of the East.\n\u201cI can give you two Sheep and a Cow,\u201d said the woman.\n\u201cI have livestock-\u201d said Nessarose, but Elphaba interrupted and said, \u201cDid you say Sheep? A\nCow? You mean Animals?\u201d\n\u201cMy very own Animals,\u201d the woman replied proudly.\n\u201cHow do you come to own Animals?\u201d Elphaba asked, her teeth clenched. \u201cAre Animals no\nmore than chattel now in Munchkinland?\u201d\n\u201cElphie, please,\u201d said Nessarose quietly.\n\u201cWhat will you take to release them?\u201d demanded Elphie, in a passion.\n\u201cI already said. Do something about this woodcutter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d interrupted Nessarose, displeased that her sister was usurping her\nrole as arbiter ofjustice.\n\u201cI brought you his axe. I thought you might bewitch it and cause it tokill him.\u201d\n\u201cFie,\u201d said Elphaba, but Nessarose said, \u201cOh well, that wouldn\u2019t be very nice.\u201d\n\u201cVery nice?\u201d Elphie said. \u201cNo indeed it wouldn\u2019t be very nice, Nessie.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re the legal answer around here,\u201d said the old woman stoutly. \u201cWhat do you\nsuggest?\u201d\n\u201cI might bewitch his axe and let it slip,\u201d said Nessarose thoughtfully, \u201cjust enough perhaps to\ncut off his arm. I know from experience that a person without an arm isn\u2019t as desirable to the\nopposite sex as one fully armed.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said the woman, \u201cbut if it doesn\u2019t work I\u2019ll come back and you\u2019ll do more, for\nthe same price. Sheep and a Cow don\u2019t come cheap around here, you know.\u201d\n\u201cNessarose, you\u2019re not a witch, no, I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cYou don\u2019t do spells, of all\nthings!\u201d\n\u201cThe righteous person can work miracles in the honor of the Unnamed God,\u201d said Nessarose\ncalmly. \u201cShow me that axe, if you\u2019ve brought it.\u201d\nThe old woman held forward a woodcutter\u2019s axe, and Nessarose knelt down near it, as if she\nwere praying. It was an odd, even a frightening thing, to see that narrow armless body able to lean\nforward, unaided and off balance, and then, when the spell was through, able to right itself. Those\nare some shoes, thought Elphie soberly, bitterly. Glinda has got some power in her, for all her social\ndazzle, or maybe the power comes from the love of our father for his Nessie. Or some combination.\nAnd if Nessarose isn\u2019t pulling the wool over this old biddy\u2019s eyes, she\u2019s become a sorceress too, by\n\n\fwhatever name she chooses to call it.\n\u201cYou are a witch,\u201d said Elphaba again; she couldn\u2019t help it. This perhaps was a mistake, as the\nold woman was just thanking Nessarose for her efforts. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the Animals by the barn out back,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cThey\u2019re tethered in town.\u201d\n\u201cAnimals! Tethered!\u201d exclaimed Elphie, seething.\n\u201cThank you, Miss Eminence,\u201d said the old woman. \u201cThe Eminence of the East. Or should I call\nyou the Witch of the East?\u201d She grinned toothily, having gotten her way, and went out the door\ncarrying the enchanted axe over her shoulder the way a strapping young lumberjack would do.\nThey weren\u2019t to be alone again for a while. Elphaba went prowling around the stable and sheds\nuntil she found an attendant who could point her toward the two Sheep and the Cow. They were in a\npen with clean straw, each one facing a different corner, chewing in abstraction.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the new Animals, brought here by that old vengeful fiend,\u201d said Elphaba. The Cow\nlooked over as if unaccustomed to being addressed. The Sheep made no sign of having understood.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your beef?\u201d said the Cow, in a dark humor.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living in the Vinkus,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many Animals there. At one time I\nwas an agitator in the Animal Rights grassroots sweep-I don\u2019t really know how things stand for\nMunchkinlander Animals now. What can you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you to mind your own business,\u201d said the Cow.\n\u201cAnd the Sheep?\u201d\n\u201cThese Sheep can tell you nothing, they\u2019ve gone dumb.\u201d\n\u201cAre they-sheep? Does that happen?\u201d\n\u201cThey talk about humans becoming vegetables-or nuts-or even fruits,\u201d said the Cow, \u201cbut they\ndon\u2019t mean it literally. Sheep don\u2019t become sheep, they become mute Sheep. They don\u2019t really need\nto be discussed here as if they\u2019re not listening, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. My apologies,\u201d she said to the Sheep, one of whom blinked balefully. To the Cow\nshe added, \u201cI\u2019d rather call you by your name.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve given up using my name in public,\u201d said the Cow. \u201cIt\u2019s not afforded me any individual\nrights to have an individual name. I reserve it for my private use.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI feel the same. I\u2019m just the Witch now.\u201d\n\u201cHer Eminence herself?\u201d A gummy rope of spittle dropped from the Cow\u2019s jaw. \u201cI\u2019m flattered.\nI didn\u2019t know you called yourself Witch, I thought that was just a nasty backfield nickname. The\nWitch of the East.\u201d\n\u201cWell no. I\u2019m her sister. I suppose I\u2019m the Witch of the VVest, if you will.\u201d She grinned. \u201cIn\nfact I didn\u2019t know she was so disliked.\u201d\nThe Cow had blundered. \u201cSurely I meant no disregard to your family,\u201d she said. \u201cI should just\nkeep my mouth closed and concentrate on my cud. The thing is, I\u2019m In shock-to be sold in exchange\nfor a witch\u2019s spell! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that woodcutter-oh I\u2019ve got ears, I have, though they\nforget-and the thought of a warmhearted simpleton like Nick Chopper coming to harm through a\nwitch\u2019s spell-and I part of the barter cost-well, it\u2019s hard to imagine how much lower one could sink\nin life.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to free you,\u201d Elphie said.\n\u201cBy whose authority?\u201d The Cow snorted suspiciously.\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m the sister of the Eminent Thropp-the Eminence of the East.\u201d She amended\nherself: \u201cThe Witch of the East. It\u2019s my prerogative here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd free to go where? To do what?\u201d said the Cow. \u201cWe\u2019d get from here to Lower Mucksiop\nand be roped in again. Subjected to slavery under the Wizard, and catechisms under the Eminent\nThropp! We don\u2019t exactly blend in with those creepy little Munchkinlander humans.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cYou\u2019re gone a bit dour,\u201d said Flphaba.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of a mad Cow?\u201d she answered. \u201cSweetheart, my udder is sore from\ntheir daily yanking. I am tapped for milk morning and night. I won\u2019t even go into what it\u2019s like to be\nmounted by a-well, just never mind. But worst, my children have been fattened on milk and\nslaughtered for veal. I could hear their cries from the abattoir, they didn\u2019t even bother to move me\nout of hearing range!\u201d Here she turned her head to the wall, and the Sheep came up on either side of\nher, pressing like a living pair of warm bookends against her lower sides and underbelly.\nElphaba said, \u201cI can\u2019t be sorrier or more ashamed. Look, I was working with Doctor\nDillamond-have you heard of him?-in Shiz, years ago. I went to the Wizard himself to protest what\nwas happening..\n\u201cOh, the Wizard doesn\u2019t show himself to the likes of us,\u201d said the Cow, after she had regained\nher composure. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like talking anymore. Everybody\u2019s on your side until they want\nsomething from you. The Eminent Nessarose has probably brought us in order to impress us into\nsome religious ceremonial procession. My silken flanks tarted up with garlands or the like. And we\nall know what happens next.\u201d\n\u201cNow you must be wrong in that,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI do object.\nNessarose is a strict unionist. They don\u2019t go in for-blood sacrifice-\u201c\n\u201cTimes change,\u201d said the Cow. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got a population of illeducated, nervous subjects to pacify. What, pray tell, works better than ritual slaughter?\u201d\n\u201cBut however could it come to this?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cAssuming you\u2019re telling the truth? This is\nfarming country. You ought to be well established here.\u201d\n\u201cAnimals in pens have lots of time to develop theories,\u201d said the Cow. \u201cI\u2019ve heard more than\none clever creature draw a connection between the rise of tiktokism and the erosion of traditional\nAnimal labor. We weren\u2019t beasts of burden, but we were good reliable laborers. If we were made\nredundant in the workforce, it was only a matter of time before we\u2019d be socially redundant too.\nAnyway, that\u2019s one theory. My own feeling is that there is real evil abroad in the land. The Wizard\nsets the standard for it, and the society follows suit like a bunch of sheep. Forgive the slanderous\nreference,\u201d she said, nodding to her companions in the pen. \u201cIt was a slip.\u201d\nElphaba threw open the gate of the pen. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re free,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you make of it\nis your own affair. If you turn it down, it\u2019s on your own heads.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on our own heads if we walk out, too. Do you think a Witch who would charm an axe to\ndismember a human being would pause over a couple of Sheep and an annoying old Cow?\u201d\n\u201cBut this might be your only chance!\u201d Elphaba cried.\nThe Cow moved out, and the Sheep followed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an exercise\nin your education, not ours. Mark my words, my rump\u2019ll be served up rare on your finest Dixxi\nHouse porcelain dinner plates before the year is out.\u201d She mooed a last remark-\u201cI hope you choke\u201dand, tail swishing the flies, she meandered away.\nAn ambassador from the Glikkus, darling,\u201d Nessarose said, when Elphaba demanded a meeting.\n\u201cReally, I can\u2019t turn her away. She\u2019s come to discuss mutual defense pacts in the event that the\nGlikkus\nsecedes next. She thinks there are agents trailing her family, and she needs to leave on her return\njourney tonight. But we\u2019ll dine together, just like old times? You, me, and my server?\u201d\nElphaba had no choice but to while away another afternoon. She located Frex and persuaded\nhim to go for a stroll out beyond the ornamental ponds and pristine lawns, where the woods came up\nto the back edge of Colwen Grounds. He walked so stiffly, so slowly, it was torture; she was a\nstrider. But she kept herself in check.\n\u201cHow do you find your sister?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAfter all these years? Much changed?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cShe was always confident, in her way,\u201d Elphie said reservedly.\n\u201cI never thought so, and I don\u2019t now,\u201d Frex said. \u201cBut I think it was a good act, and it\u2019s gotten\nbetter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat really did you ask me to come here for, Papa?\u201d Elphaba said. \u201cI haven\u2019t much time, you\nknow. You must be frank.\u201d\n\u201cYou would make a smarter Eminence than Nessie,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s your birthright. Yes, I\nknow the strict rules of title inheritance weren\u2019t important to your mother. I just think that the people\nof Munch-kinland would do better with you at the helm. Nessa is-too devout, if such a thing exists.\nToo devout to be a central figure in public life, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThis may be the only respect in which I take after my mother,\u201d Elphaba said, \u201cbut an inherited\nposition is of no interest to me, and it carries no weight at all that I\u2019m the rightful Eminence. I\u2019ve\nlong ago abdicated my position in the family in that respect. Nessarose has every right to abdicate\nhers, and then Shell can be located to stand in. Or better yet, the foolish custom can be abolished,\nand let the Munchkinlanders govern themselves to death.\u201d\n\u201cNobody ever suggested a leader isn\u2019t just as much a scapegoat as a lowly peon,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s possible. But I\u2019m talking about leadership, not about rank and privilege. I\u2019m talking\nabout the nature of the times we live in, and the job that needs to be done. Fabala, you were always\nthe more capable sibling. Shell is a madcap cutup, currently playing secret agent, and Nessie is a\nbruised little girl-\u201c\n\u201cOh please,\u201d she said in disgust. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to get over that?\u201d\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, hurt. \u201cDo you see her wrapped in some\nlover\u2019s arms? Do you see her bearing her own children, engaging in life in a way that makes\nsense? She hides behind her devotion the way a terrorist hIdes behind his ideals-\u201d He saw her ffinch\nat this, and paused.\n\u201cI have known terrorists capable of love,\u201d she said evenly, \u201cand I have known good maunts,\nunmarried and childless, doing charity for stricken people.\u201d\n\u201cHave you known Nessa to have an adult bond with anyone other than the Unnamed God?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had your wife and your children, but they came lower on\nthe order of priorities than Quadlings waiting to be converted.\u201d\n\u201cI did what had to be done,\u201d he said rigidly. \u201cI won\u2019t be lectured by my daughter.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t be lectured by you about my everlasting duties to Nessie. I gave her my\nchildhood, I got her going at Shiz. She\u2019s made her life the way she wants it, and she still has choice\nand free will even now. And so do her subjects, who can depose her and cut off her head if her\nprayers get in their way.\u201d\n\u201cShe is a rather powerful woman,\u201d Frex said sadly. Elphie glanced sideways at him, and for the\nfirst time she saw him as feckless-the kind of old man that Irji, if he survived, would grow to be.\nConstantly pawing at the edge of events, reacting instead of acting, mourning the past and praying for\nthe future instead of stirring up the present.\n\u201cHow did she get so powerful?\u201d she asked, trying to be kind. \u201cShe had two good parents.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer this.\nThey walked on and came out of the woods along the edge of a cornfield. A couple of\nfarmhands were repairing a fence and erecting a scarecrow. \u201cAfternoon, Brother Frexspar,\u201d they\nsaid, doffing theft caps. They looked a little askance at Elphaba. When she and her father had\ncontinued out of earshot, she said, \u201cThey were wearing a little talisman or something on theft tunics,\ndid you see it? It looked like a small straw dolly or something.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, the straw man.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnother pagan custom that had almost gone underground,\nand then was revived during the Great Drought. Ignorant field-workers wear a straw man as a charm\n\n\fagainst the pests of crops: drought, crows, insects, rot. Once upon a time there was a\ntradition of human sacrifice about it.\u201d He paused to catch his breath and wipe his face. \u201cOur\nfamily friend, Turtle Heart, the Quadling-he was butchered right here in Coiwen Grounds, on the day\nthat Nessarose was born. An itinerant dwarf and a huge tiktok entertaining clock were making the\ncircuit that year, and providing a conduit for the ugliest of human inclinations. We arrived here just\nin time for Turtle Heart to be nabbed. I\u2019ve never forgiven myself for not seeing what was about to\nhappen-but your mother was in her labor, and we\u2019d been run out of town. I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly\nenough all the way around things.\u201d\nElphaba had heard all this before-even so. \u201cYou were in love with him,\u201d she said, to make it\neasier.\n\u201cWe both were, we shared him,\u201d said Frex. \u201cYour mother and I did. It was a lifetime ago and I\ndon\u2019t know why anymore; I don\u2019t think I knew why then. I haven\u2019t loved anyone else since your\nmother died, except of course my children.\u201d\n\u201c\\Vhat a brutal history of sacrifices,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just talking to a Cow who expects to be a\nblood victim. Is that possible?\u201d\n\u201cThe more civilized we become, the more horrendous our entertainments,\u201d said Frex.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019ll never change, or will it? I remember the etymology of the word Oz, at least as\nproposed at a lecture by our Head, Madame Morrible. She said that academics were inclined to\nlocate the root of the term in the Gillikinese cognate oos, which carries freights of meaning about\ngrowth, development, power, generation. Even ooze, with its distant companion noun virus, is\nthought to belong to the same general family. The older I get, the more accurate this derivation seems\nto be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet the poet of the Oziad calls it \u2018Land of green abandon, land in endless leaf.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cPoets are just as responsible for empire building as any other professional hacks.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I would give anything to get away from here, but I dread the thought of a trip across\nthe deadly sands.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only a legend,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cPapa, you taught me that the sands are no more deadly\nthan these fields. That reminds me of the other theory, that Oz is related to the word oasis. \\Vhat the\nnomadic peoples of the north thought of Gillikin, time beyond thinking, when Oz was first\ndiscovered and settled. Now look, Papa, you needn\u2019t go so far. The Vinkus is nearly another\ncountry. Why don\u2019t you come back with me?\u201d\n\u201cI would love to, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how could I leave Nessarose? I never could.\u201d\n\u201cEven if she\u2019s Turtle Heart\u2019s daughter and not yours?\u201d she said, stingingly because stung.\n\u201cEspecially if that,\u201d he answered.\nAnd Elphaba saw that by not knowing for sure if Nesssarose had been fathered by himself or by\nTurtle Heart, Frex had decided in some subrational way that she was the daughter of them both.\nNessarose was the proof of their brief union-thefts, and, obviously, Melena\u2019s as well. It didn\u2019t\nmatter how crippled Nessarose was; she would always be more than Elphaba, always. She would\nalways mean more.\nElphaba and Nessarose sat in Nessa\u2019s bedchamber. A handmaid served some soup made of\ncow\u2019s stomach. Elphie, not normally squeamish, couldn\u2019t eat it. The maid neatly spooned tiny\nportions into Nessie\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to beat around the bush,\u201d Nessarose said. \u201cI would like you to join me here as a\nsister-at-arms, to lead my circle of advisors and to manage in my absence if I should travel.\u201d\n\u201cI have no love of Munchkinland, from what I\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cThe people are\ncruel and impressed by charades, the pomp of this place is oppressive, and I do believe you\u2019re\nsitting on a powder keg.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cAll the more reason you should stay and help me,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cWeren\u2019t we raised up to\nexpect a life of service?\u201d\n\u201cYour shoes have made you strong,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cI didn\u2019t know shoes could do that. I don\u2019t\nthink you need me. Don\u2019t lose those shoes, though.\u201d She thought: Your shoes give you an unnatural\nbalance. You look like a serpent standing on its tail.\n\u201cSurely you remember them from before?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I hear Glinda amplified them with a magic spell, or something.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that Glinda! What a card.\u201d Nessie swallowed and smiled. \u201cWell, you can have the shoes,\nmy dear-over my dead body. I\u2019ll rewrite my will and leave them to you. Though what they would do\nfor you, I can hardly imagine. They didn\u2019t grow me new arms. Perhaps enchanted shoes\nwon\u2019t change the color of your skin but will make you enticing enough so that it won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m already too old to be that enticing.\u201d\n\u201cWhy you\u2019re still in the prime of life, and so am I!\u201d said Nessarose, laughing. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve\ngot some romancing man in a Vinkus yurt or tent or teepee or whatever it is they call home there.\nCome on.\u201d\n\u201cI have been wondering something, ever since I saw you do that spell this morning,\u201d Elphie\nsaid. \u201cThe spell over the axe.\u201d\n\u201cOh right. Small potatoes, that one.\u201d\n\u201cDo you by any chance remember that time in Shiz, when Madame Morrible said she was\nputting us under a spell? And that we couldn\u2019t talk to each other about it?\u201d\n\u201cGo on. Sounds familiar. She was so creepy, wasn\u2019t she? A master of tyranny.\u201d\n\u201cShe said she had chosen us-me, you, and Glinda-to be Adepts. To be agents of someone quite\nhigh up. To be sorceresses and, I don\u2019t know, secret accomplices. She promised we\u2019d be highly\nplaced and effectual. She made us think we couldn\u2019t ever discuss it with one another.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, that. I do remember. What a witch she was.\u201d\n\u201cWell, do you think there\u2019s any truth to that? Do you think she had the power to bind us into\nsilence? To make us powerful sorceresses?\u201d\n\u201cShe had the power to scare us out of our wits, but we were young and very stupid, as I\nremember.\u201d\n\u201cI had the feeling at the time that she was in collusion with the Wizard, and that she ordered her\ntiktok thing-Grommetik, the name\u2019s just come back to me, isn\u2019t memory odd like that-to kill Doctor\nDillamond.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw fiends with knives behind every chair, you always did,\u201d Nessarose said. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink that Madame Morrible had any real power. She was a manipulative woman, but her power was\nvery limited, and in our naivete we saw her as a villain. She was merely full of self-importance.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder. I tried to say something about it afterward. Didn\u2019t we all faint?\u201d\n\u201cWe were innocent and horribly suggestible, Elphie.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Glinda\u2019s gone on to marry money, as Madame Morrible said. Is Sir Chuffrey still alive?\u201d\n\u201cIf you can call it that, yes. And Glinda is a sorceress, there\u2019s no questioning that. But Madame\nMorrible was merely predicting things to us; she saw our talents, as an educator could be expected\nto do, and she advised us on how to make the most of them. What\u2019s so surprising about that?\u201d\n\u201cShe tried to seduce us into a secret service for an unknown master. I\u2019m not inventing this,\nNessie.\u201d\n\u201cShe knew how to get toyou, obviously, by appealing to your sense of conspiracy. I don\u2019t\nremember such alluring nonsense.\u201d\nElphaba fell silent. Perhaps Nessie was right. And yet here they were, a dozen years later: two\nWitches, in a manner of speaking. And Glinda a sorceress for the public good. It was enough to make\n\n\fElphie go back to Kiamo Ko and burn that Grimmerie, and burn the broom too, for that matter.\n\u201cShe always reminded Glinda of a carp,\u201d said Nessarose. \u201cCan you really be scared of a fish,\nafter all these years?\u201d\n\u201cI saw in a book once a drawing of a lake monster, or a sea monster if you believe in oceans,\u201d\nsaid Elphie. \u201cI may not be sure if monsters exist, but I\u2019d rather live my life in doubt than be\npersuaded by a real experience of one.\u201d\n\u201cYou said much the same thing about the Unnamed God once,\u201d said Nessarose quietly.\n\u201cOh, now please don\u2019t start on that.\u201d\n\u201cA soul is too valuable to ignore, Elphie.\u201d\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t it good I don\u2019t have one then, so there\u2019s no muss, no fuss.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a soul. Everyone does.\u201d\n\u201cHow about the Cow you bartered for today, and the Sheep?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about lower orders.\u201d\n\u201cThat sort of talk offends me, Nessie. I freed those Animals today, you know.\u201d\nNessarose shrugged. \u201cYou have some rights in Colwen Grounds. I\u2019m not going to walk around\nprohibiting your little pet missions.\u201d\n\u201cThey said some pretty horrible things about how Animals are being treated here. I thought it\nwas the Emerald City and Gillikin only; I somehow guessed Munchkinland, being more rural, would\nhave more common sense.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Nessie, indicating that the maid should wipe her mouth with a napkin, \u201conce\nat a prayer service I met a soldier. He had lost a limb in a campaign against some restless Quadlings.\nHe said every morning he slapped the stump where his arm used to be. He got the blood ringing, and\nafter a few minutes there was a tingling sensation, and he developed a kind of phantom limb. Not all\nat once, and not in physical form: What he regained was a sense of what it had felt like. It would\ngrow to the elbow, and then his memory, his bodily memory, of limbs in three-dimensional space,\nwould extend, eventually, all the way down to his fingers. Once his phantom limb was in place,\nmentally, that is, he could face the day as a crippled man. Furthermore, he had better physical\nbalance.\u201d\nElphaba, feeling more and more like a real Witch, looked at her sister, waiting for the punch.\n\u201cI tried it for a while. For months in fact. I had Nanny massage my little knobs there. After much\nhard work on poor Nanny\u2019s part, I began to develop just the beginning of a sense of what it would be\nlike to have arms. It never went very far, until Glinda dazzled up these shoes. Now- I don\u2019t know\nwhy, maybe they\u2019re too tight and my circulation is complaining\u2013after an hour on my feet, I have\nphantom arms. First time in my life. I can\u2019t quite get the feel of fingers.\u201d\n\u201cPhantom limbs,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cWell, I\u2019m pleased for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, if you slapped yourself around, spiritually speaking,\u201d said Nessarose, \u201cyou might\ndevelop a phantom soul, or something that felt like one. It\u2019s a good internal guide, a soul. I suspect\nyou might even recognize that it\u2019s not a phantom at all-it\u2019s a real one.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll do, Nessie,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cI don\u2019t care to discuss my spiritual trials with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here with me, join my staff, and we can have you baptized,\u201d said\nNessarose warmly.\n\u201cWater is profoundly painful to me, as you well know, and I won\u2019t discuss it again. I can\u2019t\npledge allegiance to anything Unnamed. It\u2019s a sham.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re condemning yourself to a life of sadness,\u201d Nessarose said.\n\u201csVell, that I\u2019m already familiar with, so at least there\u2019s nothing to jump out and surprise me.\u201d\nElphie threw down her napkin. \u201cI can\u2019t stay\nhere, Nessie. I can\u2019t help you out. I have responsibilities of my own back in the Vinkus, which\n\n\fyou have shown precious little interest in finding out about. Oh, all right, I know, a revolution has\noccurred and you\u2019re a new prime minister or something, you surely have a right to be distracted if\nanyone does. Either accept the burden of leadership or turn it down, but either way make sure it\u2019s\nyour choice in the matter, and not an accident of history, a martyrdom by default. I worry about you,\nbut I can\u2019t stay and be your dogsbody.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been clumsy and outspoken. Don\u2019t expect me to remember how to be sisterly in such a\nshort while-\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had Shell to practice on all these years,\u201d Elphaba said sternly.\n\u201cJust like that, you\u2019re getting up and going?\u201d Nessarose stood too, in that sinuous, unsettling\nway she had. \u201cAfter twelve years of separation, we have three, four days of reunion and that\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cKeep yourself well,\u201d Elphie said, and kissed her sister on both cheeks. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be a\ngood Eminence for as long as you want to be.\u201d\n\u201cI shall pray for your soul,\u201d promised Nessarose.\n\u201cI shall wait for your shoes,\u201d Elphie answered.\nOn her way out, Elphie thought about going to say good-bye to her father, and then decided\nagainst it. She had said to him everything that she could bring herself to say. They had ganged up on\nher, in the claustrophobic, lovIng way of families, and she wanted no more of it.\nTaking the northern route over the Madeleines, she realized she would pass Lake Chorge. She\ndecided to pause there, about halfway home, interested to note that she was actually glad to be\nheading back. She paced the edge of the lake, looking for Caprice-in-the-Pines, but she could not\npick it out of the many resort villas that had sprung up since that visit in her youth.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the visible terrain she was really seeing. It was the world at large. The character\nit seemed to have, how it seemed to refer to itself. How could Nessarose believe in the Unnamed\nGod? Behind every\naspect of the world is another aspect of the world. In a sense, wasn\u2019t that what Doctor\nDillamond had been on about? He had imagined another true foundation of the world, defensible by\nproofs and experiments; he had figured out how to locate it. But she was not a visionary. Behind the\nblue and white marbleized paper of the lake, beyond the watered silk of the sky, Elphaba couldn\u2019t\nsee any deeper in.\nNot about the raw material of life: the muscle structure of angels\u2019 wings, the capillary action\ninvolved in focusing a gimlet gaze. Nor about the gooey subjects of the empyrean: not about good, if\nthe Unnamed God was good. Not about evil, either.\nFor who was in thrall to whom, really? And could it ever be known? Each agent working in\ncollusion and antagonism-like the cold and the sun alike creating a deadly spear of ice . . . Was the\nWizard a charlatan, a fraud, a despot of merely human power and failure? Did he control the AdeptsNessarose and Glinda, and an unnamed third, for it surely wasn\u2019t Elphie-or was it only put to him by\nMadame Morrible that he did, to assuage his obvious ego, his appetite for the semblance of power?\nAnd Madame Morrible? And Yackle? Was there any connection? Were they the same person,\nwere they harsh divinities, avatars of a power of darkness, were they poisonous flitches struck from\nthe evil body of the Kumbric Witch? Or were they-singly, or together-old Kumbricia herself, or such\nas could be presumed to have survived from the heroic age of mythology into these crabbed,\ncramped, modern days? Did they govern the Wizard, jerk him about like a marionette?\nWho is in thrall to whom?\nAnd while you wait to learn, the deadly icicle, formed by all opposing forces, falls and drives\nits cold nail into penetrable flesh.\nShe left the pine-needled shores of Lake Chorge in a state of high frustration and energy. Having\nno confidence to decide about matters of political or theological hierarchy, she felt driven to dig up\n\n\fthose old notes she had collected from Doctor Dillamond\u2019s study the day after he was murdered.\nSomething concrete under her fingertips. A magnifying lens, a surgical knife, a sterilized probe.\nPerhaps now she was old enough to understand what he had been getting at. He had been a unionist\nessentialist; she was a novice atheist. But she still might profit from his work, after all this time.\nThe winds were with her as far as the lower slopes of the Great Kells. Thereafter she had a\nharder time, both finding her way and keeping her seat. A number of times she had to dismount and\nwalk. Fortunately it wasn\u2019t very cold, and she came upon small clusters of nomads in the protected\nvales, who kept her heading in the right direction. Still, she was two weeks returning, even with the\nhelp of a broom.\nLate in the afternoon, with the sun still hot and high compared to its winter habits, she toiled her\nway up the last slopes, Kiamo Ko raising its narrow dark profile above her. She felt like a child\nlooking up at the top hat of a very tall gentleman. Eager to avoid ceremony and fuss, she skirted the\nvillage. Without the broom this approach would be nearly impossible; as it was, even the broom\nseemed to be feeling the effort. She came to a halt in the orchard, made her way to the back door, and\nfound it open, which meant the sisters were out flower picking or some such nonsense.\nThe place was quiet. She grabbed a browning apple from the sideboard and trudged up the\nsteps of her tower without running into anyone. When she passed Nanny\u2019s room, she rattled the\ndoorknob and said, \u201cNanny?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d came a little shriek, \u201cyou startled me!\u201d\n\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\n\u201cJust a minute.\u201d There was the sound of furniture being dragged away from the door. \u201cWell, this\nis a fine mess, Miss Elphaba! Going off and leaving us to be murdered in our beds, or just as likely!\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Let me in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd not saying a word. You had us frantic with worry-\u201d The last piece scraped across the\nfloor, and Nanny flung open the door. \u201cYou hideous ungrateful woman!\u201d She fell heavily into her\narms and burst into tears.\n\u201cPlease, I\u2019ve had enough drama to last me the rest of my life,\u201d said Elphaba. \u201cWhat are you\ngoing on about?\u201d\nNanny took some while to calm down. She rummaged through her bag for some smelling salts,\npulling out enough little bottles and satchels to set up her own apothecary business. There were blue\nglass vials, clear piliboxes, snakeskin envelopes of powders and pills, and a beautiful green glass\nbottle that had an old torn label on it, MIRACLE ELI-.\nShe administered calming agents to herself, and when she could breathe again, she said, \u201cWell,\nyou know-my dear-you saw I suppose, that everyone has disappeared?\u201d\nElphaba scowled in confusion. And rising, sudden fear.\nNanny took a deep breath. \u201cNow don\u2019t be angry at Nanny. It\u2019s not Nanny\u2019s fault. Those soldiers\nsuddenly decided that their exercises were finished. I don\u2019t know how, maybe Nor told them you\nwere gone? She told us; she\u2019d been sneaking around looking for your broom, and she said you\nweren\u2019t here. So maybe she mentioned it to them. You know how nice they were to her, how they\nadored her. The soldiers came to the front door and said that they needed to escort the entire family,\nSarima and her sisters and Nor and Irji, back to their base camp, wherever it is. They didn\u2019t require\nme, they said, which was very insulting indeed, and I let them know as much. Sarima asked why, and\nthat nice Commander Cherrystone said that it was for their own protection. In case a fighting\nbattalion comes through, he said, it won\u2019t do to have any members of the ruling family still here, or\nthere might be a bloody incident.\u201d\n\u201cComing through, a battalion? When?\u201d Elphie hit the windowsill with her open palm.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you. No time soon, he said; this is just advance planning. They became\n\n\finsistent. Those soldiers scattered the peasants in the village-I don\u2019t think there was any killing, it all\nseemed quite humane, except for the chains-and only I was left behind, being too old to march down\na mountain, and no relation besides. Also, they left Liir, since he was no threat and I think they\u2019d\nbecome fond of him. But a few days later Lift disappeared, too. I\u2019m sure he was desperately lonely\nfor them, and he must have followed them to their camp.\u201d\n\u2018And nobody protested?\u201d shrieked Elphie.\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me. Of course they protested. Well, Sarima fell in a heap, fainting dead away,\nand liji and Nor looked after her. But the sisters, that mealy-mouthed lot, they barricaded the dining\nroom and set fire to the chapel wing, trying to draw attention, and Three slammed a sharpening stone\non the hand of Commander Cherrystone and broke every bone in his wrist, I bet. Five and Six rang\nthe bell, but the shepherds are too far away, and it all happened too fast. Two wrote messages and\ntried to tie them to the feet of your crows, but they wouldn\u2019t be liberated, they just kept roosting on\nthe wIndowsills again, useless old things. Four had a great idea about boiling oil, but they couldn\u2019t\nget the flame high enough.\nOh, it was a merry chase here for a day or two, but of course the soldiers won. Men always\nwin.\u201d\nNanny continued petulantly, \u201cAnd we all thought they\u2019d ambushed you earlier, to get you out of\nthe way. You\u2019re the only effective one here, everyone knows that. They all think you\u2019re a Witch. The\ntownspeople told me that if you come back you\u2019re to be in touch with the hamlet of Red Windmill\ndown below the dam, you know the one. They seem to think you can rescue their royal family, such\nas they are. I told them it was misplaced trust, that you wouldn\u2019t be interested, but I promised to give\nyou the message, so there it is.\u201d\nElphaba strode back and forth. She pulled her hair from its customary knot and shook it out, as\nif trying to shake away what she was hearing. \u201cAnd Chistery?\u201d she said at last.\n\u201cCowering behind the piano in the music room, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is a fine kettle of fish.\u201d\nShe strode, she sat, she stroked her chin, she kicked Nanny\u2019s chamber pot and broke it. \u201cWhat\nhave I got,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cThere\u2019s the broom. There\u2019s the bees. There\u2019s the monkey. There\u2019s\nKillyjoy-did they hurt Killyjoy? There\u2019s Killyjoy. There\u2019s the crows. There\u2019s Nanny. There\u2019s the\nvillagers, if they\u2019re unharmed. There\u2019s the questionable Grimmerie. It\u2019s not a lot.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Nanny, sighing. \u201cDoom, doom, I say.\u201d\n\u201cWe can get them back,\u201d said Elphie. \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\u201cCount Nanny in,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cthough I never did like those sisters, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\nElphie clenched her fists and tried to keep from striking herself. \u201cLiir gone too,\u201d she said. \u201cI\ncame here to make my apologies to Sarima, and I lost Liir in the bargain. Am I good for nothing in\nthis life?\u201d\nKiamo Ko was deathly still, except for old Nanny\u2019s labored breathing as she took a catnap in\nher rocking chair. Killyjoy thumped his tail on the floor, happy to see his mistress. The sky was\nbroad and hopeless beyond the windows. Elphaba was tired herself, but she couldn\u2019t sleep. For,\nfrom time to time, she imagined she could hear the sound of water lapping against the sides of the\nfishwell, as if the legendary underground lake were rising to drown them all.\n\n\fWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked\nWitch of the West\n\n\fBook 5 - The Murder and Its Afterlife\nAfterward, there was a lot of discussion about what people had thought it was. The noise had\nseemed to come from all corners of\nthe sky at once.\nJournalists, armed with the thesaurus and apocalyptic scriptures, fumbled and were defeated by\nit. \u201cA gulfy deliquescence of deranged and harnessed air\u201d A volcano of the invisible, darkly\nconstrued\u201d To the pleasure faithers with tiktok affections, it was the sound of clockworks uncoiling their\nsprings and running down at a terrible speed. It was the release of vengeful energy.\nTo the essentialists, it seemed as if the world had suddenly found itself too crammed with life,\nwith cells splitting by the billions, molecules uncoupling to annihilation, atoms shuddering and\njuggernauting in their casings.\nTo the superstitious it was the collapsing of time. It was the oozing of the ills of the world into\none crepuscular muscle, intent on stabbing the world to its core for once and for all.\nTo the more traditionally religious it was the blitzkrieg of vengeful angel armies, the awful\nname of the Unnamed God sounding itself at last-surprise-and the evaporation of all hopes for mercy.\nOne or two pretended to think it was squadrons of flying dragons overhead, trained for attack,\nbreaking the sky from its moorings by the thrash of tripartite wings.\nIn the wake of the destruction it caused, no one had the hubris or courage (or the prior\nexperience) to lie and claim to have known the act oi terror for what it was: a wind twisted up in a\nvortical braid.\nIn short: a tornado.\nThe lives of many Munchkinlanders were lost-along with square miles of topsoil from hundred\nof years of cultivation. The shifting margins of sand in the eastern desert covered several villages\nwithout a trace, and no survivors were left to tell the tale of their suffering. Whirling like something\nfrom a nightmare, the wind funnel drove into Oz thirty miles north of Stonespar End, and delicately\nmaneuvered around Colwen Grounds, leaving every rose petal attached and every thorn in place.\nThe tornado\nsliced through the Corn Basket, devastating the basis of the economy of the renegade nation, and\npetered out, as if by design, not only at the eastern terminus of the largely defunct Yellow Brick\nRoad, but also at the precise spot-the hamlet of Center Munch-where, outside a local chapel,\nNessarose was awarding prizes for perfect attendance at religious education classes. The storm\ndropped a house on her head.\nAll the children survived to pray for Nessarose\u2019s soul at the memorial service. Perfect\nattendance was never more perfect.\nThere were a great many jokes about the disaster, naturally. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from destiny,\u201d\nsome said, \u201cthat house had her name on it.\u201d \u201cThat Nessarose, she was giving such a good speech\nabout religious lessons, she really brought down the house!\u201d \u201cEverybody needs to grow up and leave\nhome sometimes, but sometimes HOME DOESN\u2019T L1KE FE.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a\nshooting star and a falling house?\u201d \u201cOne which is propitious grants delicious wishes, the other which\nis vicious squishes witches.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s big, thick, makes the earth move, and wants to have its way\nwith you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but can you introduce me?\u201d\nSuch a maelstrom had not been known in Oz before. Various terrorist groups claimed credit,\nespecially when news got around that the Wicked Witch of the East-also known as the Eminent\nThropp, depending on your political stripe-had been snuffed out. It was not widely understood at\n\n\ffirst that the house carried passengers. The mere presence of a house of exotic design, set down\nalmost intact upon the platform rigged up for the visiting dignitaries, was stretching credulity enough.\nThat creatures might have survived such a fall was either patently unbelievable or a clear indication\nof the hand of the Unnamed God in the affair. Predictably, there were a few blind people who\nsuddenly cried \u201cI can see!\u201d a lame Pig that stood and danced a jig, only to be led away-that sort of\nthing. The alien girl-she called herself Dorothy-was by virtue of her survival elevated to living\nsainthood. The dog was merely annoying.\nWhen the news of Nessarose\u2019s premature death arrived at Kiamo Ko by carrier pigeon, the\nWitch was deep in an operation of sorts, stitching the wings of a white-crested male roc into the\nback mus\ndes of one of her current crop of snow monkeys. She had more or less perfected the procedure,\nafter years of botched and hideous failures, when mercy killing seemed the only fair thing to do to the\nsuffering subject. Fiyero\u2019s old schoolbooks in the life sciences, from Doctor Nikidik\u2019s course, had\ngiven some leads. Also the Grimmerie had helped, if she was reading it correctly: She had found\nspells to convince the axial nerves to think skyward instead of treeward. And once she got it right,\nthe winged monkeys seemed happy enough with their lot. She had yet to see a female monkey in her\npopulation produce a winged baby, but she still had hopes.\nCertainly they had taken better to flying than they had to language. Chistery, now a patriarch in\nthe castle menagerie, had plateaued at words of one syllable, and still seemed to have no clear idea\nof what he was saying.\nIt was Chistery, in fact, who brought the pigeon\u2019s letter in to Elphaba\u2019s operating salon. The\nWitch had him hold the fascia-slasher while she unfolded the page. Shell\u2019s brief message told of the\ntornado and informed her of the memorial service, which was scheduled for several weeks later in\nthe hope that she would receive this message in time to come.\nShe put the message down and went back to work, placing grief and regret away from her. It\nwas a tricky business, wing attachment, and the sedative she had administered to this monkey\nwouldn\u2019t last all morning.\n\u201cChistery, it\u2019s time to help Nanny down the stairs, and find Liir if you can, and tell him I need to\ntalk to him at lunch,\u201d she said, through her gritted teeth, glancing again at her own diagrams to make\nsure she had the overlapping of muscle groups in the correct arrangement, front to back.\nIt was an achievement if Nanny could now make it to the dining room once a day. \u201cThat\u2019s my\njob, that and sleeping, and Nanny does both very well,\u201d she said every single noontime when she\narrived, hungry from her exertions on the stairs. Liir put out the cheese and bread and the occasIonal\ncold joint, at which the three of them hacked and nibbled, usually in an unsocial mood, before darting\noff to their afternoon chores.\nLiir was fourteen, and insisted he was going to accompany the Witch to Colwen Grounds. \u201cI\nhave never been anywhere, except that time with the soldiers,\u201d he complained. \u201cYou never let me do\nanything.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to stay and take care of Nanny,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cNow there isn\u2019t any point in\narguing about it.\u201d\n\u201cChistery can do it.\u201d\n\u201cChistery can\u2019t. He\u2019s getting forgetful, and between him and Nanny they\u2019d burn the place to the\nground. No, there\u2019s no more discussion about it, Liir; you\u2019re not going. Besides, I\u2019m going to have to\ntravel on my broom, I think, to get there in time.\u201d\n\u201cYou never let me do anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou can do the washing up.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWhat\u2019s he arguing about now, sweet thing?\u201d asked Nanny loudly.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell her?\u201d said Liir. \u201cShe helped raise Nessarose, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s too old, she doesn\u2019t need to know. She\u2019s eighty-five, it\u2019ll only upset her.\u201d\n\u201cNanny,\u201d said lAir, \u201cNessie\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cHush, you useless boy, before I remove your testicles with my foot.\u201d\n\u201cNessie did what?\u201d screeched Nanny, looking rheumily out at them.\n\u201cDid died dead,\u201d intoned Chistery.\n\u201cDid what?\u201d\n\u201cNessie DIED,\u201d said Liir.\nNanny began to weep at the idea before she had even confirmed it. \u201cCan this be true, Elphie? Is\nyour sister dead?\u201d\n\u201cLiir, you\u2019ll answer for this,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cYes, Nanny, I cannot lie to you. There was a\nstorm and a building collapsed. She went very peacefully, they say.\u201d\n\u201cShe went straight to the bosom of Lurlina,\u201d said Nanny, sobbing. \u201cLurlina\u2019s golden chariot\ncame to take her home.\u201d She patted the piece of cheese on her plate, inexplicably. Then she buttered\na napkin and took a bite. \u201cWhen do we leave for the funeral?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re too old to travel, dear. I\u2019m going in a few days. Liir will stay and look after you.\u201d\n\u201cI wIll not,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good boy,\u201d said Nanny, \u201cbut not as good as Nessarose. Oh, sorrowful day! Liir, I\u2019ll\ntake my tea in my room, I can\u2019t sit and talk to you\n335\nas if nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d She hauled herself to her feet, leaning on Chistery\u2019s head. (Chistery\nwas devoted to her.) \u201cYou know, darling,\u201d she said to the Witch, \u201cI don\u2019t think the boy is old enough\nto see to my needs. What if the castle is attacked again? Remember what happened the last time you\nwent away.\u201d She made a small, accusatory moue.\n\u201cNanny, the Arjiki militia guard this place day and night. The Wizard\u2019s army is well housed in\nthe town of Red Windmill down below. They have no intention of leaving that safe haven and risking\ndecimation in these mountain passes-not after what they did. That was their skirmish, that was their\ncampaign. Now they\u2019re just watchdogs. They staff the outpost to report signs of an invasion or\ntrouble from the mountain clans. You know that. You have nothing to fear.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too old to be taken in chains like poor Sarima and her family,\u201d Nanny said. \u201cAnd how\ncould you rescue me, if you couldn\u2019t get them back?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still working on that,\u201d said the Witch into Nanny\u2019s left ear.\n\u201cSeven years. You\u2019re very stubborn. It\u2019s my opinion they\u2019re all moldering in a common grave,\nthese seven long years. Liir, you have to thank Lurlina that you weren\u2019t among them.\u201d\n\u201cI tried to rescue them,\u201d said Liir stubbornly, who had rewritten the escapade in his own mind\nto give himself a more heroic role. It was not longing for the companionship of soldiers, he told\nhimself, no, it was a courageous effort to save the family! In fact, Commander Cherrystone out of\nkindness had had Liir tied up and left him in a sack in someone\u2019s barn, to prevent their having to\nincarcerate him with the others. The Commander had not realized Liir was a bastard son of Fiyero,\nfor Liir himself didn\u2019t know it.\n\u201cYes well, that\u2019s a good boy.\u201d Nanny was now distracted from the sad news, drifting back to\nthe tragedy she remembered more viscerally. \u201cOf course I did everything I could, but Nanny was an\nold woman even then. Elphie, do you think they\u2019re dead?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI could find out nothing,\u201d said the Witch for the ten thousandth time. \u201cIf they were spirited to\nthe Emerald City or if they were murdered, I could not tell. You know this, Nanny. I bribed people. I\nspied around. I hired agents to follow every lead. I wrote to the Princess Nastoya of the Scrow for\nadvice. I spent a year following every useless clue. You know this. Don\u2019t torture me with the\nmemory of my failure.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my failure, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Nanny peacefully; they all knew\nshe didn\u2019t think so for a minute. \u201cI should have been younger and more vigorous. I\u2019d have given\nthat Commander Cherrystone a piece of my mind! And now Sarima is gone, gone, and her sisters too.\nI suppose it\u2019s none of our fault, really,\u201d she concluded disingenuously, scowling at the Witch. \u201cYou\nhad someplace to go, so you went; who can criticize you for that?\u201d\nBut the Image of Sarima in chains, Sarima as a decaying corpse, still withholding from the\nWitch her forgiveness for Fiyero\u2019s death-it pained her like water. \u201cGive up, you old harridan,\u201d said\nthe Witch, \u201cmust my own whip me so? Go have your tea, you fiend.\u201d\nThe Witch sat down at last and thought of Nessarose, and what might come. The Witch had tried\nto stay removed from the affairs of the political world, but she knew a change of leadership in\nMunchkinland could throw things out of balance-maybe to a positive effect. She felt a guilty lightness\nat the death of her sister.\nShe made a list of things to bring with her to the memorial service. Foremost was a page of the\nGrimmerie. In her chamber she pored over the huge musty tome, and finally she ripped out an\nespecially cryptic page. Its letters still continued to contort beneath her eyes, sometimes scrambling\nand unscrambling as she looked, as if they were formed by a colony of ants. Whenever she gazed at\nthe book, meaning might emerge on a page that a day earlier had been illegible chicken scratches;\nand meaning sometimes disappeared as she stared. She would ask her father, who with his holy eyes\nwould see the truth better.\nColwen Grounds was draped in black swags and purple bunting. When the Witch arrived, she\nwas greeted by a one-man less-than-welcoming committee, a bearded Munchkinlander named Nipp,\nwho seemed to be concierge, janitor, and acting Prime Minister. \u201cYour lineage no longer allows you\nany particular liberties in Munchkinland,\u201d she was told. \u201cWith the death of Nessarose, the honorific\nof Eminence is at last abolished.\u201d The Witch didn\u2019t much care, but she wasn\u2019t inclined to accept a\nunilateral dictum without a retort. She answered, \u201cIt is abolished when I accept that it is abolished.\u201d\nNot that the honorific had been used much in recent years; according to the occasional rambling letter\nfrom Frex,\nNessarose had begun to be amused by the slur of \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d and had\nconsidered it a public penance worthy of a person with such high moral standing. She even took to\nreferring to herself as such.\nNipp showed her to her room. \u201cI don\u2019t need much,\u201d said the Wicked Witch of the West (as, in\ncontrast, she allowed herself to be called, at least by these Munchkinlander upstarts). \u201cA bed for a\ncouple of days, and I\u2019d like to see my father and attend the service. I\u2019ll collect a few things, and be\noff soon. Now, do you know if our brother, Shell, will be here?\u201d\n\u201cShell has disappeared again,\u201d said Nipp. \u201cHe left his regards. There is a mission he is\nundertaking in the Glikkus, it can\u2019t wait. Some of us think he is defecting, worried about a change in\ngovernment here now that the tyrant is dead. As well he might,\u201d he added coldly. \u201cHave you fresh\ntowels?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t use them,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cit\u2019s all right. Go away now.\u201d She was very tired, and sad.\nAt sixty-three, Frex was even balder, and his beard whiter, than he had been last time. His\nshoulders hunched in, as if trying to meet each other, his head sank into a natural cavity made by a\ndeteriorating spine and neck. He sat covered by a blanket on the verandah. \u201cAnd who is this,\u201d he\n\n\fsaid when the Witch came up and sat next to him. She realized his sight had nearly gone for good.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your other daughter, Papa,\u201d she said, \u201cthe one that\u2019s left.\u201d\n\u201cFabala,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat will I do without my pretty Nessarose? How will I live without my\npet?\u201d\nShe held his hand until he fell asleep, and wiped his face though his tears burned her skin.\nThe liberated Munchkinlanders were destroying the house. The Witch had no use for frippery,\nbut it seemed a shame to waste a property this way. Desecration was so shortsighted; didn\u2019t they\nknow that, however they now decided to live, Colwen Grounds could be their parliament building?\nShe spent time with her father, but they didn\u2019t speak much. One morning, when he was more\nalert and energetic than usual, he asked her if she really was a witch. \u201cOh well, what\u2019s a witch? Who\nhas ever trusted language in this family?\u201d she replied. \u201cFather, will you look at something\nfor me? Will you tell me what you see?\u201d She withdrew from an inner pocket the page from the\nGrimmerie and she unfolded it like a large napkin on his lap. He ran his hands over it, as if he could\npick up meaning through his fingertips, and then held it near, peering and squinting.\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan you tell me the nature of this writing? Is it for good or for\nill?\u201d\n\u201cThe markings are crisp enough, and large. I ought to be able to make it out.\u201d He turned it\nupside down. \u201cBut little Fabala, I can\u2019t read this alphabet. It is in a foreign tongue. Can you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sometimes I seem to be able to, but the talent is fleeting,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI don\u2019t know\nIf it\u2019s my eyes or if it\u2019s the manuscript that\u2019s being tricky.\u201d\n\u201cYou always had strong eyes,\u201d said her father. \u201cEven as a toddler you could see things no one\nelse could.\u201d\n\u201cHah,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cYou had a looking glass that sweet Turtle Heart made for you, and you looked in it as if you\ncould see other worlds, other times.\u201d\n\u201cI was probably looking at myself.\u201d\nBut they both knew that wasn\u2019t true, and Frex, for once, said so. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look at yourself,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cyou hated to. You hated your skin, your sharp features, your strange eyes.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did I learn that hate?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYou were born knowing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a curse. You were born to curse my life.\u201d He\npatted her hand affectionately, as if he didn\u2019t mean much by this. \u201cWhen you lost your weird baby\nteeth, and your second teeth came in normally, we all relaxed a little. But for the first couple of\nyears-until Nessarose was born-you were a little beast. Only when saintly Nessarose was delivered\nto us, even more scarred than you, did you settle down like a normal child.\u201d\n\u201cWhy was I cursed to be different?\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a holy man, you must know.\u201d\n\u201cYou are my fault,\u201d he said. Despite his words he was somehow pinning blame on her instead\nof himself, though she still wasn\u2019t clever enough to see how this was done. \u201cFor what I had failed to\ndo, you were born to plague me. But don\u2019t worry yourself about it now,\u201d he added, \u201cthat\u2019s all long\nago.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Nessarose?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do the weights and balances of shame and guilt account for\nher?\u201d\n\u201cShe is a portrait of the lax morals of your mother,\u201d Frex said calmly.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you could love her so much,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cBecause her human frailty\nwasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stew so, you always stewed,\u201d Frex said. \u201cAnd now she is dead, so what does it\nmatter?\u201d\n\u201cMy life is still running on.\u201d\n\n\f\u201cBut mine is running out,\u201d he answered, sadly. So she put his hand back on his lap, and kissed\nhim gently, and folded up the page of the Grimmerie and tucked it in her pocket. Then she turned to\ngreet the person approaching them across the lawn. She thought it was someone with tea (Frex was\nstill accorded a measure of service, due to his age and his mildness, and, she supposed, his\nvocation), but she stood and pressed down the front of her homespun black skirt when she saw who\nit was.\n\u201cMiss Glinda of the Arduennas,\u201d she said, her heart churring.\n\u201cOh, you came, I knew you would,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cMiss Elphaba, the last true Eminent Thropp,\nno matter what they say!\u201d\nGlinda approached slowly, either through age or shyness, or because her ridiculous gown\nweighed so much that it was hard for her to get up enough steam to stride. She looked like a huge\nGlindaberry bush, was all the Witch could think; under that skirt there must be a bustle the size of the\ndome of Saint Florix. There were sequins and furbelows and a sort of History of Oz, it seemed,\nstitched in trapunto in six or seven ovoid panels all around the skirting. But her face: beneath the\npowdered skin, the wrinkles at eyelid and mouth, was the face of the timid schoolgirl from the Pertha\nHills.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed a whit,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cIs this your father?\u201d\nThe Witch nodded but shushed her; Frex had dropped off again. \u201cCome, we\u2019ll walk in the\ngardens before they root up the roses out of some beknighted attempt at eradicating injustice.\u201d The\nWitch took Glinda\u2019s arm. \u201cGlinda, you look hideous in that getup. I thought you\u2019d have developed\nsome sense by now.\u201d\n\u201cWhen in the provinces,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to show them a little style. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so\nbad. Or are the satin bells at the shoulder a bit too too?\u201d\n\u201cExcessive,\u201d agreed the Witch. \u201cSomeone get the scissors; this is a disaster.\u201d\nThey laughed. \u201cMy dear, what they\u2019ve done to this grand old place,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cLook, those\npediments are meant to support graven urns, and those revolutionary slogans are painted all over that\nexquisite belvedere. I hope you\u2019ll have something done, Elphie. There isn\u2019t a belvedere to match that\noutside of the capital.\u201d\n\u201cI never had the love of architecture that you did, Glinda,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI just read the\nslogans: SHE WALKED ALL OVER us. Why shouldn\u2019t they paint all over her belvedere? If she did\nin fact walk all over them?\u201d\n\u201cTyrants come and go, belvederes are forever,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI can recommend topnotch\nrestorers the moment you ask.\u201d\n\u201cI hear you were one of the first on the scene,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cwhen Nessarose died. How did\nthat come to be?\u201d\n\u201cSir Chuifrey-my hubby-he has some investments in pork futures, you know, and Munchkinland\nis trying to diversify its economic base so as not to be at the mercy of Gillikin banks and the Emerald\nCity Corn Exchange. You never know what relationship might develop between Munchkinland and\nthe rest of Oz, and it\u2019s best to be prepared. So where Sir Chuifrey does business, I do good. It\u2019s a\npartnership made in heaven. You know I have more money than I can give away?\u201d She giggled and\nsqueezed the Witch\u2019s arm. \u201cI never imagined that doing public charity would provide such a rush.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were here in Munchkinland-?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I had been at an orphanage on the shores of Mossmere, and for a lark I thought I\u2019d go to\nthe game park-they have dragons there now, and I\u2019d never seen a dragon-so I was scarcely a dozen\nmiles away when the storm hit. We had terrible winds even there; I cannot imagine how a ceremony\ncould have been in progress in Center Munch. In Mossmere there were whole sections of the park\nclosed to visitors due to the fear of falling trees and escaping Animals-\u201c\n\n\f\u201cOh, so they call it a game park, with Animals?\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cYou must go, dear, it\u2019s a lark. Well, as I was saying, the house came right out of the blue, and I\nsuppose I mean that literally-if they\u2019d sensed a big storm, they\u2019d surely have canceled the event and\nrun for cover. Anyway, the news system is very advanced now in parts of\nMunchkinland; Nessarose herself oversaw a system of beacons and tiktok code signals, to warn\nof invasions from the Wizard and points west. So it was only a matter of minutes before the news\nwas being flashed in all directions. I commandeered a Mature Pfenix and asked her to bring me to\nCenter Munch, and I arrived before most of the locals had quite figured out what had hit them.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to hear there was no blood. I venture to guess there were massive internal\ninjuries, but there was no blood. Of course Nessarose\u2019s last few devoted followers thought this\nmeant her spirit was taken up intact, and that she suffered little. I don\u2019t imagine she suffered much,\nnot with that kind of clonk on the noggin. Her more unhappy subjects, who were the greater in\nnumber, thought it a droll act of Lurlina, releasing them from Nessarose\u2019s particular sort of\nfundamentalist bondage. There was revelry when I arrived, and much feting of the funny girl and the\ndog who seem to have lived in the house.\u201d\n\u201cOh, who\u2019s that?\u201d said the Witch, who hadn\u2019t heard this part.\n\u201cWell, you know how Munchkinlanders bow and scrape no matter what their democratic\ninclinations. No sooner had I arrived than they deferred to me, introducing me as a witch. I tried to\ncorrect them, a sorceress is really much more apt, but never mind. It was no doubt the outfit, it\ncowed them. I was in a salmon-pink fantasy that day, and really it suited me.\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said the Witch, who had never liked talking about clothes.\n\u201cWell, the child introduced herself: Dorothy from Kansas. I didn\u2019t know the place, and said as\nmuch. She appeared as much surprised as anyone else about what had happened, and she had a nasty\nlittle pooch yapping about her heels. Tata or Toto or something. Toto. So this Dorothy was in some\nstate of shock, I can tell you. A fairly homely little girl with little fashion sense, but I suppose that\ncomes later in life for some than others.\u201d She glanced sideways at the Witch. \u201cMuch later, in some\ncases.\u201d And they both chuckled at that.\n\u201cDorothy supposed she should try to get back to her home, but as she couldn\u2019t remember having\nstudied anything about Oz in school, nor could I recall a place named Kansas, we decided that she\nshould look for help elsewhere. The fickle MunchkInlanders seemed ready to nominate her as\nNessie\u2019s successor, which would have angered Nipp and all those\nministers in Coiwen Grounds who\u2019ve spent their careers jockeying for position when and if\nNessarose ever saw fit to die. Besides, there may be other developments afoot. Dorothy might have\ngotten in the way.\u201d\n\u201cAn eye to public affairs, well, somehow I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said the Witch, in fact quite\npleased. \u201cI always knew you were in there somewhere, Glinda.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I thought the better move would be to get Dorothy out of Munchkinland before a civil\nwar tore this place up even worse than it already is. There are factions, you know, who support the\nre-annexation of Munchkinland by 0z. It would do the girl no good to get caught in the crossfire of\nopposing interests.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so she\u2019s not here,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI had thought I\u2019d meet her.\u201d\n\u201cDorothy? Now you\u2019re not going to take against her, are you?\u201d said Glinda. \u201cShe\u2019s a child,\nreally. Big by Munchkinlander standards, of course, but a squat little thing nonetheless. She\u2019s an\ninnocent, Elphie; I can see by the gleam in your eye that you\u2019re up to your old paranoia thing again.\nShe wasn\u2019t piloting that house, you know, she was trapped in it. This would be one struggle you\u2019d do\nwell just to leave alone.\u201d\n\n\fThe Witch sighed. \u201cYou may be right. You know, I\u2019m getting used to stiff muscles in the\nmorning. Sometimes I think that vengeance is habit forming too. A stiffness of the attitude. I keep\nhoping that the Wizard will be toppled in my lifetime, and this aim seems to be at odds with\nhappiness. I suppose I can\u2019t take on avenging the death of a sister I didn\u2019t get on all that well with\nanyway.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially if the death is an accident,\u201d Glinda said.\n\u201cGlinda,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cI know you must remember Fiyero, and you have heard of his death.\nFifteen years ago.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, I heard he died, under mysterious circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cI knew his wife,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cand his in-laws. It was suggested to me once that he had\nbeen carrying on an affair with you in the Emerald City.\u201d\nGlinda turned yellow-pink. \u201cMy dear,\u201d she said, \u201cI was fond of Fiyero and he was a good man\nand a fine statesman. But among other things, you will remember he was dark-skinned. Even if I took\nup dal\nliances-an inclination I believe rarely benefits anyone-you are \u00b0nce again being suspicious and\ncranky to suspect me and Fiyero! The idea!\u201d\nAnd the Witch realized, sinkingly, that this was of course true; the ugly skill at snobbery had\nreturned to Glinda in her middle years.\nBut for her part, Glinda had no real iniding that the Witch was implicating herself as FIyero\u2019s\nadulterous lover. Glinda was too fussed to listen that closely. The Witch in fact alarmed her a little.\nIt was not just the novelty of seeing her again, but the strange charisma Elphaba possessed, which\nhad always put Glinda in the shade. Also there was the thrill, basis indeterminable, which made\nGlinda shy, and caused her to rush her words, and to speak in a false high voice like an adolescent.\nHow quickly you could be thrown back to the terrible uncertainty of your youth!\nFor when she chose to remember her youth at all, she could scarcely dredge up an ounce of\nrecollection about that daring meeting with the Wizard. She could recall far more clearly how she\nand Elphie had shared a bed on the road to the Emerald City. How brave that had made her feel, and\nhow vulnerable too.\nThey walked for a way In a restless silence.\n\u201cThings might begin to improve now,\u201d said the Witch after a time. \u201cI mean Munchkinland will\nbe a mess for a while. A tyrant is terrible, but at least he or she imposes order. The anarchy that\nfollows the deposition of a tyrant can be bloodier than before. Still, things may work out all right.\nFather always said that when left to themselves, the Munchklnlanders had a great deal of common\nsense. And Nessie was, for all practical purposes, a foreigner. She was raised in Quadling Country,\nand you know, she may have been half Quadling herself, I\u2019ve come to realize. She was a foreign\nqueen on this soil, despite her inherited title. With her gone, the Munchkinlanders might just right\nthemselves.\u201d\n\u201cBless her soul,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cOr do you still not believe in the soul?\u201d\n\u201cI can make no comment on the souls of others,\u201d said the Witch.\nThey walked some more. Here and there the Witch saw, as before, the totemic straw men,\npinned to tunics, and erected like effigies in the corners of fields. \u201cI find them somewhat creepy,\u201d\nshe said to Glinda. \u201cNow one other thing I want to ask you; I asked this of Nessa once. Do you\nremember Madame Momble\u2019s corralling us into her parlor, and\nproposing we become three Adepts, three high witches of Oz? Sort of secret local priestesses,\nshaping public policy behind the scenes, conujbuting to the stability-or instability-of Oz as required\nby some unnamed higher authority?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that farce, that melodrama, how could I forget it?\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI wonder if we were put\n\n\funder a spell then? Do you remember, she\npaid we couldn\u2019t talk about it, and it didn\u2019t seem that we could?\u201d\n\u201cWell we are talking about it, so if there was any truth to it, which I doubt, it\u2019s certainly worn\noff by now.\u201d\n\u201cBut look what\u2019s happened to us. Nessarose was the Wicked\nWitch of the East-you know that\u2019s what they called her, don\u2019t pretend to be so shocked-and I\nhave a stronghold in the West, and I seem to have rallied the Arjikis around me, by dint of the\nabsence of their ruling family-and there you are, sitting pretty in the North with your bank accounts\nand your legendary skills at sorcery.\u201d\nLegendary nothing I simply see to it that I am admired in the right circles,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cNow,\nmy memory is just as good as yours. And\nMadame Morrible proposed that I be an Adept of Gillikin, but that you be an Adept of\nMunchkinland, and Nessa be an Adept of Quadling\nCountry. The Vinkus she didn\u2019t think worth bothering about. If she was seeing the future, she got\nit wrong. She got you and Nessa all wrong.\u201d\n\u201cForget the details,\u201d said the Witch tartly. \u201cI just mean, Glinda, is it possible we could be\nliving our entire adult lives under someone\u2019s spell? How could we tell if we were the pawns of\nsomeone\u2019s darker game? I know, I know, I can see it in your face: Elphie,you\u2019re sniffing conspiracy\ntheories again. Butyou were there. You heard what I heard. How do you know your life hasn\u2019t been\npulled by the strings of some malign magic?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I pray a lot,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cnot terribly genuinely, I admit, but I try. I think the Unnamed\nGod would have mercy on me and give me the benefit qf the doubt, and release me from a spell if I\nhad accidentally fallen under one. Don\u2019t you? Or are you still so atheistic?\u201d\n\u201cI have always felt like a pawn,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cMy skin color\u2019s been a curse, my missionary\nparents made me sober and intense, my school days brought me up against political crimes against\nAnimals, my love life imploded and my lover died, and if I had any life\u2019s work of my own, I haven\u2019t\nfound it yet, except in animal husbandry, if you could call it that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no pawn,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI take all the credit in the world for my own foolishness. Good\ngracious, dear, all of life is a spell. You know that. But you do have some choice.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wonder,\u201d said the Witch.\nThey walked on. Graffiti was splattered on the sides of the granite plinths of statues. NOW\nTHE SHOE\u2019S ON THE OTHER FOOT. Glinda tchtched. \u201cAnimal husbandry?\u201d she said.\nThey crossed a little bridge. Bluebirds twinkled music above them like a sentimental\nentertainment.\n\u201cI sent this Dorothy, this girl, on to the Emerald City,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cI told her I\u2019d never seen\nthe Wizard-well, I had to lie, don\u2019t look at me like that; if I told her the truth about him she would\nnever have left here. I told her to ask him to send her home. With his reconnaissance spies all over\nOz, and no doubt elsewhere, he has heard of Kansas, I\u2019m sure. Nobody else has.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a cruel thing to do,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a harmless child, no one should take her seriously,\u201d said Glinda carelessly. \u201cIf the\nMunchkinlanders started rallying around her, reunification might be a more bloody affair than we all\nhope.\u201d\n\u201cSo you hope for reunification?\u201d muttered the Witch, disgusted.\n\u201cYou support it?\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d Glinda went on blithely, \u201chaving some motherly instinct somewhere inside this\npushed-up bosom of mine, I gave her Nessa\u2019s shoes as a sort of protection.\u201d\n\u201cYou what?\u201d The Witch whirled and faced Glinda. For a moment she was dumb with rage, but\n\n\fonly for a moment. \u201cNot only does she come whomping out of the sky and stepping her big clumsy\nhouse all over my sister, but she gets the shoes too? Glinda, those shoes weren\u2019t yours to give away!\nMy father made them for her! And furthermore, Nessa promised I could have them when she died!\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Glinda in a false calm, surveying the Witch up and down, \u201cand they would make\nthe perfect accessory for that glass-of-fashion outfit you have on. Come on, Elphie, since when have\nyou cared about shoes, of all things? Look at those army boots you have on!\u201d\n\u201cWhether I\u2019d wear them or not is none of your concern. You can\u2019t go handing out a person\u2019s\neffects like that, what right had you? Papa\nreshaped those shoes from skills he learned from Turtle Heart. You\u2019ve stuck your fancy wand in\nwhere it wasn\u2019t wanted!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll remind you,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cthat those shoes were coming apart until I had them resoled,\nand I laced them through with a special binding spell of my own. Neither your father nor you did that\nmuch for her. Elphie, I stood by her when you abandoned her in Shiz. As you abandoned me. You\ndid, don\u2019t deny it, stop those lightning bolt looks at me, I won\u2019t have it. I became her surrogate sister.\nAnd as an old friend I gave her the power to stand upright by herself through those shoes, and if I\nmade a mistake I\u2019m sorry, Elphie, but I still feel they were more mine to give away than yours.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I want them back,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cOh, put it behind you, will you, they\u2019re only shoes,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cyou\u2019re behaving as if\nthey\u2019re holy relics. They were shoes, and a bit out of style, truth be told. Let the girl have them. She\nhas nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cLook how the people here thought of them,\u201d said the Witch; she pointed to a stable on which\nwas scrawled, in broad red letters, WALK ALL\nOVER YOU YOU OLD WITCH.\n\u201cPlease, give it a rest,\u201d said Glinda, \u201cI have such a headache coming on.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cIf you won\u2019t retrieve them, I\u2019ll get them myself.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known you wanted them,\u201d said Glinda, trying to make things all right, \u201cI\u2019d have saved\nthem for you. But you have to see, Elphie, the shoes couldn\u2019t stay here. The ignorant pagan\nMunchkinlanders-Lurlinists all, once you scratch the skin-they had put too much credit in those silly\nshoes. I mean, a magic sword I could understand, but shoes? Please. I had to get them out of\nMunchkinland.\u201d\n\u201cYou are working in collusion with the Wizard to render Munchkinland ready for annexation,\u201d\nsaid the Witch. \u201cYou have no agenda of charity, Glinda. At least don\u2019t fool yourself. Or are you\nreally under some rusty spell of Madame Morrlble, after all this time?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t have you snapping at me,\u201d said Glinda. \u201cThe girl has left, she\u2019s been on the road for a\nweek now, she headed west. I tell you, she\u2019s only a timid child, and means no harm. She\u2019d be\ndistressed to know she\u2019d taken something you wanted. There is no power in them for you, Elphie.\u201d\nThe Witch said, \u201cGlinda, if those shoes fall into the hands of the Wizard, he\u2019ll use them\nsomehow in a maneuver to reannex Munchkinland By now they have too much significance to\nMunchkinlanders. The Wizard mustn\u2019t have those shoes!\u201d\nGlinda reached out and touched the Witch\u2019s elbow. \u201cThey won\u2019t make your father love you any\nbetter,\u201d she said.\nThe Witch pulled back. They stood glaring at each other. They had too much common history to\ncome apart over a pair of shoes, yet the shoes were planted between them, a grotesque icon of their\ndifferences. Neither one could retreat, or move forward. It was silly, and they were stuck, and\nsomeone needed to break the spell. But all the Witch could do was insist, \u201cI want those shoes.\u201d\nAt the memorial service, Glinda and Sir Chuifrey perched in the balcony reserved for\ndignitaries and ambassadors. The Wizard sent a representative, resplendent in his dress reds with\n\n\fthe emerald cross marking quadrants on his chest, a crew of bodyguards at attention all around him.\nThe Witch sat below, and did not meet Glinda\u2019s eyes. Frex wept until he brought on an attack of\nasthma, and the Witch helped him out a side door, where he could catch his breath.\nAfter the service, the Wizard\u2019s emissary approached the Witch. He said, \u201cYou have been\ninvited to an audience with the Wizard. He is traveling by special diplomatic immunity, via a Pfenix,\nto offer his condolences to the family this evening. You will be prepared to meet him at Colwen\nGrounds this evening.\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t come here!\u201d said the Witch. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d\n\u201cThose who now make the decisions think otherwise,\u201d said the emissary. \u201cBe that as it may, he\ncomes under cover of darkness, and only to speak to you and your family.\u201d\n\u201cMy father is not up to receiving the Wizard,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI won\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\u201cHe will see you, then,\u201d said the emissary. \u201cHe insists. He has questions of a diplomatic nature\nto put to you. But you are not to make this visit public, or it could go very hard on your father and\nyour brother.\nAnd on you,\u201d he added, as if that were not already evident.\nShe considered how she might use this command audience to her own advantage: Sarima, the\nsafety of Frex, the fate of Fiyero. \u201cI agree,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI will meet him.\u201d And, despite herself,\nshe was glad for a Moment that Nessarose\u2019s magicked shoes were safely out of the vicinity.\nAs the vesper bells rang, the Witch was summoned from her room by a Munchkinlander maid.\n\u201cYou will have to submit to a search,\u201d said the Wizard\u2019s emissary, meeting her in an antechamber.\n\u201cYou must understand the protocol here.\u201d\nShe concentrated on her fury as she was probed and prodded by the officers who ringed the\nwaiting area. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d they said when they found the page of the Grimmerie in her pocket.\n\u201cOh that,\u201d she said, thinking fast. \u201cHis Highness will want to see that.\u201d\n\u201cYou can bring nothing in with you,\u201d they told her, and they took the page from her.\n\u201cBy my bloodlines, I can reinstate the office of the Eminent Thropp tonight and have your leader\narrested,\u201d she called after them. \u201cDo not tell me what I can and cannot do in this house.\u201d\nThey paid her no mind and ushered her into a small chamber, bare but for a couple of\nupholstered chairs set upon a flowery carpet. Along the baseboards, dust mice rolled in the draft.\n\u201cHis Highness, the Emperor Wizard of Oz,\u201d said an attendant, and withdrew. For a minute the\nWitch sat alone. Then the Wizard walked into the room.\nHe was without disguise, a plain-looking older man wearing a high-collared shirt and a\ngreatcoat, with a watch and fob hanging from a waistcoat pocket. His head was pink and mottled,\nand tufts of hair stuck out above his ears. He mopped his brow with a handkerchief and sat down,\nmotioning the Witch to sit, too. She did not sit.\n\u201cHow do you do,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat do you want with me,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cThere are two things,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is what I had come here to say to you, and then there is\nthe matter of what you bring to my attention.\u201d\n\u201cYou talk to me,\u201d she said, \u201cfor I have nothing to say to you.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no point in beating around the bush,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to know your intentions\nabout your position as the last Eminence.\u201d\n\u201cHad I any intention,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be none of your business.\u201d\n\u201cAh, alas, it is my business, for reunification is under way,\u201d said the Wizard, \u201ceven as we\nspeak. I understand that Lady Glinda, bless her well-meaning foolishness, has sensibly evacuated\nboth the unfortunate girl and the totemic shoes from the district, which should make annexation less\ntroublesome. I should like to have those shoes in my possession, to prevent their giving you ideas. So\n\n\fyou see, I need to know your Intentions in the matter. You were not, I take it, in warm sympathy with\nyour sister\u2019s style of religious tyranny, but I hope you do not intend to set up shop here. If you do, we\nmust strike a little bargain-something I was never able to do with your sister.\u201d\n\u201cThere is little for me here,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cand I am not suited to govern anyone, not even\nmyself, it seems.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, there\u2019s the small matter of the army at-is it Red \\Vindmill?-the town below Kiamo\nKo.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been there all these years,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cTo keep you in check,\u201d he said. \u201cAn expense, but there you are.\u201d\n\u201cTo spite you, I should reclaim the title of Eminence,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cBut I care little for these\nfoolish people. What the Munchkinlanders do now is of no interest to me. As long as my father is left\nunharmed. If that is all-\u201c\n\u201cThere is the other matter,\u201d he said. His manner became more lively. \u201cYou brought a page with\nyou. I wonder where you got it?\u201d\n\u201cThat is mine and your people have no right to it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I want is to know where you got it, and where I can find the rest.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you give me if I tell you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat could you want from me?\u201d\nThis was why she had agreed to meet him. She drew a deep breath, and said, \u201cTo know if\nSarima, Dowager Princess of the Atlikis, is still alive. And where I might find her, and how I might\nnegotiate her freedom.\u201d\nThe Wizard smiled. \u201cHow all things work together. Now isn\u2019t it interesting that I could guess of\nyour concern.\u201d He waved a hand.\nUnseen attendants outside the open door ushered in a dwarf in clean white trousers and tunic.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t a dwarf, she saw; it was a young woman crouching. Chains sewn into the collar of\nher tunic ran through her clothes to her *nldes, keeping her bent over; the chains were only two or\nthree feet long. The Witch had to peer to see for sure that it was Nor. She would be sixteen by now,\nor seventeen. The age that Elphie had been when she went up to Crage Hall at Shiz.\n\u201cNor,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cNor, are you there?\u201d\nNor\u2019s knees were filthy and her fingers curled around the links of her bondage. Her hair was cut\nshort, and welts were visible beneath the patchy tresses. She tossed her head as if listening to music,\nbut she would not shIft her gaze toward Elphaba.\n\u201cNor, it\u2019s Auntie Witch. I\u2019ve come to bargain for your release, at last,\u201d said the Witch,\nimprovising.\nBut the Wizard motioned the unseen attendants to usher Nor out of sight. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that is not\npossible,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is my protection from you, you see.\u201d\n\u201cThe others?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI must know.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is undocumented,\u201d said the Wizard, \u201cbut I believe Sarima and her sisters are all\ndead.\u201d\nThe Witch\u2019s breath caught in her chest. The last hopes of forgiveness gone!. . . but the Wizard\nwas continuing. \u201cPerhaps some underling who had no authority in the matter had an appetite for a\nbloodbath. It\u2019s so hard to get reliable help in the armed forces.\u201d\n\u201cIrji?\u201d said the Witch, gripping her elbows.\n\u201cNow he had to die,\u201d said the Wizard apologetically. \u201cHe was the next in line to be Prince,\nwasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cTell me it was not brutal,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cOh, tell me so!\u201d\n\u201cThe Paraffin Necklace,\u201d admitted the Wizard. \u201cWell, it was a public affair. A statement\n\n\fneeded to be made. There now, against my better judgment, I have told you what you wanted to\nknow. Now it is your turn. Where can I find the book that this page is from?\u201d The Wizard took the\npaper out of his pocket and pressed it out onto his lap. His hands were trembling. He looked at the\npage. \u201cA spell for the Administration of Dragons,\u201d he said, wonderingly.\n\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d she said, surprised. \u201cI could not be sure.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You must have a hard time making this out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, it does not come\nfrom this world. It comes from my world.\u201d\nHe was mad, obsessed with other worlds. Like her father.\n\u201cYou are not telling the truth,\u201d said the Witch, hoping she was right.\n\u201cOh, what care I for the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am truthful, as it happens.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d said the Witch, trying to buy some time, trying to figure out how\nshe could barter for Nor\u2019s life. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it is. I don\u2019t believe you do either.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an ancient manuscript of magic, generated in a world far away from\nthis one. It was long thought to be merely leg. endary, or else destroyed in the dark onslaughts of the\nnorthern invaders. It had been removed from our world for safety by a wizard more capable than I. It\nis why I came to Oz in the first place,\u201d he continued, almost talking to himself, as old men are prone\nto do. \u201cMadame Blavatsky located it in a crystal ball, and I made the appropriate sacrifices andarrangements- to travel here forty years ago. I was a young man, full of ardor and failure. I had not\nintended to rule a country here, but just to find this document and return it to its own world, and to\nstudy its secrets there.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of sacrifices?\u201d she said. \u201cYou do not stint from murder here.\u201d\n\u201cMurder is a word used by the sanctimonious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an expedient expression with\nwhich they condemn any courageous action beyond their ken. What I did, what I do, cannot be\nmurder. For, coming from another world, I cannot be held accountable to the silly conventions of a\nnaive civilization. I am beyond that lisping childish recital of wrongs and rights.\u201d His eyes did not\nburn as he spoke; they were sunk behind veils of cold blue detachment.\n\u201cIf I give the Grimmerie to you, will you go?\u201d she said. \u201cGive me Nor and take your brand of\nevil and leave us alone at last?\u201d\n\u201cI am too old to travel now,\u201d he said, \u201cand why should I give up what I have worked for all\nthese years?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I will use this book and destroy you with it if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou cannot read it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are of Oz and you cannot do such a thing.\n\u201cI can read more of it than you suspect,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not know what it all means. I have seen\npages about unleashing the hidden energies of matter. I have seen pages about tampering with the\norderly flow of time. I have seen disquisitions about weapons too vile to use, about how to poison\nwater, about how to breed a more docile population. There are diagrams of weapons of torture.\nThough the drawings and the words seem misty to my eyes, I can continue to learn. I am not too old.\u201d\n\u201cThose are ideas of great interest to our times,\u201d he said, though he seemed surprised that she\nhad taken in as much as she had.\n\u201cNot to me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have done enough already. If I give it to you, will you surrender\nNor to me?\u201d\n\u201cYou should not trust my promise,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cReally, my child.\u201d But he continued to\nstare at the page she had handed over to him. \u201cOne might learn how to subjugate a dragon to one\u2019s\nown purposes,\u201d he mused, and flipped the page over to read what was on the back.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have never begged for anything before in my life. But I beg of you.\nIt is not right that you should be here. Assuming for a moment you can sometimes tell the truth-go\nback to that other world, go anywhere, just leave the throne. Leave us alone. Take the book with you,\n\n\fdo with it what you will. Let me accomplish at least this in my life.\u201d\n\u201cIn exchange for my telling you about the kith and kin of your beloved Fiyero, you are to tell me\nwhere this book is,\u201d he reminded her.\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have revised my offer. Give me Nor, and I will get you the\nGrimmerie. The book is already hidden so deeply that you will never find it. You have not the skill.\u201d\nShe hoped she was being persuasive.\nHe stood and pocketed the page. \u201cI shall not have you executed,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least, not at this\naudience. I will have that book, for here or for there. You cannot bind me to a promise, I am beyond\nbeing bound by words. I will think of what you have said. But meanwhile, I will keep my young\nslave-girl at my side. For she is my defense against your anger.\u201d\n\u201cGive her to me!\u201d said the Witch. \u201cNow, now, now: Act like a man, not like a mountebank!\nGive her to me and I will send you that book!\u201d\n\u201cIt is for others to bargain,\u201d said the Wizard. Rather than sounding offended, he seemed merely\ndepressed, as if he were talking to himself instead of to her. \u201cI do not bargain. But I do think I will\nwait and see how the reunification with Munchkinland goes, and if you do not interfere, I may be\nkindly disposed to think about what you have said. But I do not bargain.\u201d\nThe Witch breathed in deeply. \u201cI have met you before, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou once granted\nme an interview in the Throne Room, when I was a schoolgirl from Shiz.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d he said. \u201cOh, of course-you must have been one of the darling girls of Madame\nMorrible. That wonderful aid and helpmeet. In her dotage now, but in her heyday, what she taught me\nabout breaking the spirits of willful young girls! No doubt, like the rest, you were taken with her?\u201d\n\u201cShe tried to recruit me to serve some master. Was it you?\u201d\n\u201cWho can say. We were always hatching some plot or other. She was good fun. She would\nnever be as crude as that\u201d-he pointed to the open door through which crouching Nor could still be\nseen, humming to herself-\u201cshe could manage girl students with much greater finesse!\u201d He was about\nto leave the room, but he turned back at the door. \u201cYou know, now I remember. It was she who\nwarned me about you. She told me you had betrayed her, you had rejected her offers. She was the\none who advised me to have you watched. It is because of her that we found out about your little\nromance with the diamond-skinned prince.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\u201cSo you met me before. I had forgotten. In what form did I appear?\u201d She had to clutch herself to\nkeep from vomiting. \u201cYou were a skeleton with lighted bones, dancing in a storm.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. That was clever, that was. Were you impressed?\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cI think you are a very bad wizard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d he answered, stung, \u201care only a caricature of a witch.\u201d\n\u201cWait,\u201d she called as he headed away through the panel, \u201cwait, please. How will I receive your\nanswer?\u201d\n\u201cI will send a messenger to you before the year is out,\u201d he said. The panel slammed tightly\nbehind him.\nShe fell to her knees, her forehead dropping almost to the floor. At her sides her fists clenched.\nShe had no intention of surrendering the Grimmerie to such a monster, ever. If need be she would die\nto keep it\nout of his hands. But could she arrange a deception so that he would surrender Nor to her first?\nShe left a few days later, first making sure that her father was not to be turned out of his room in\nColwen Grounds. He did not want to join her in the Vinkus; he was too old to make the journey.\nBesides, he thought that Shell would come back sooner or later looking for him. The Witch knew that\nFrex wouldn\u2019t live long, grieving so for Nessarose. She tried to put away her anger at him when she\n\n\fsaid good-bye for what she suspected was the last time.\nAs she strode through the forecourt of Colwen Grounds, she crossed paths once again with\nGlinda. But both women averted their eyes and hurried their feet along their opposing ways. For the\nWitch, the sky was a huge boulder pressing down on her. For Glinda it was much the same. But\nGlinda wheeled about, and cried out, \u201cOh Elphie!\u201d\nThe Witch did not turn. They never saw each other again.\nShe knew that she couldn\u2019t afford the time to mount a full-scale chase against this Dorothy.\nGlinda ought to be hiring accomplices to track those shoes down; it was the least she could do, with\nher money and her connections. Still, the Witch stopped here and there along the Yellow Brick Road,\nand asked those taking an afternoon tipple at a roadside public house if they had seen a foreign girl in\nblue and white checks, walking with a small dog. There was some animated discussion as the\npatrons of the pub struggled to decide whether the green Witch intended the child harm-apparently\nthe child had that rare skill of enchanting strangers- but when they had satisfied themselves that no\nharm was likely, they responded. Dorothy had come through a few days ago, and it was said that she\nhad spent the night with someone a mile or two down the road, before continuing on. \u201cThe well-kept\nhouse with the yellow domed roof,\u201d they said, \u201cand the minaret-chimney. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\nThe Witch found it, and she found Boq on a bench in the yard, dandling a baby on his knee.\n\u201cYou!\u201d he said. \u201cI know why you\u2019re here! Milla, look, who\u2019s here,\ncome quickly! It\u2019s Miss Elphaba, from Crage Hall! In the flesh!\u201d\nMilla came, a couple of naked children clutching her apron strings. Flushed from laundry, she\nlifted her straggling hair out of her eyes and said, \u201cOh my, and we forgot to dress in our finery today.\nLook who\u2019s come to laugh at us in our rustic state.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she something!\u201d said Boq fondly.\nMilla had kept her figure, though there were four or five offspring in evidence, and no doubt\nmore out of sight. Boq had gone barrelchested, and his fine spiky hair had grown prematurely silver,\ngiving him a dignity he had never had as an undergraduate. \u201cWe heard about your sister\u2019s death,\nElphie,\u201d he said, \u201cand we sent our condolences to your father. We didn\u2019t know where you were. We\nheard you had come here following Nessie\u2019s ascension to governor of Munchkinland, but we didn\u2019t\nknow where you went back to when you left. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d\nThe sourness that she had felt over Glinda\u2019s betrayal was ameliorated by Boq\u2019s common\ncourtesy and direct speech. She had always liked him, for his passion and for his sense. \u201cYou are a\nsight, you are,\u201d she said.\n\u201cRikla, get up off that stool and let our guest have a seat,\u201d said Milla to one of the children.\n\u201cAnd Yellowgage, run to Uncle\u2019s and borrow some rice and onions and yogurt. Hurry now, so I can\nstart a meal.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t be staying, Milla, I\u2019m in a hurry,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cYellowgage, don\u2019t bother. I\u2019d love\nto spend some time, and catch up on all your news, but I\u2019m trying to locate this girl stranger, who\npassed by here, someone said, and stayed a night or two.\u201d\nBoq shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cWell, she did that, Elphie. What do you want with her?\u201d\n\u201cI want my sister\u2019s shoes. They belong to me.\u201d\nBoq seemed as surprised as Glinda had. \u201cYou weren\u2019t ever into fancy trappings like society\nshoes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, well, perhaps I\u2019m about to make my belated debut in Emerald City society at last, and\nhave a coming-out ball.\u201d But she was being tart with Boq, and didn\u2019t want that. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal\nmatter, Boq; I want the shoes. My father made them and they\u2019re mine now, and Glinda gave them to\nthis girl without my permission. And woe betide Munchkinland if they fall into the Wizard\u2019s hands.\nWhat is she like, this Dorothy?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cWe adored her,\u201d he said. \u201cPlain and straightforward as mustard seed. She shouldn\u2019t have any\nproblems, although it\u2019s a long walk for a child, from here to the Emerald City. But all who see her\nare bound to help her, I\u2019d say. We sat up till the moon rose, chatting about her home, and Oz, and\nwhat she might expect on the road. She hasn\u2019t traveled widely before this.\u201d\n\u201cHow charming,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cHow novel for her.\u201d\n\u201cAre you brewing one of your campaigns?\u201d said Milla suddenly, cannily. \u201cYou know, Elphie,\nwhen you didn\u2019t come back from the Emerald City with Glinda that time, everyone said you\u2019d gone\nmad, and had become an assassin.\u201d\n\u201cPeople always did like to talk, didn\u2019t they? That\u2019s why I call myself a witch now: the Wicked\nWitch of the West, if you want the full glory of it. As long as people are going to call you a lunatic\nanyway, why not get the benefit of it? It liberates you from convention.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wicked,\u201d said Boq.\n\u201cHow do you know? It\u2019s been so long,\u201d said the Witch, but she smiled at him.\nBoq returned the smile, warmly. \u201cGlinda used her glitter beads, and you used your exotic looks\nand background, but weren\u2019t you just doing the same thing, trying to maximize what you had in order\nto get what you wanted? People who claim that they\u2019re evil are usually no worse than the rest of us.\u201d\nHe sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s people who claim that they\u2019re good, or anyway better than the rest of us, that you\nhave to be wary of.\u201d\n\u201clike Nessarose,\u201d said Milla meanly, but she was telling the truth, too, and they all nodded.\nThe Witch took one of Boq\u2019s children on her knee and clucked at it absentmindedly. She liked\nchildren no more than she ever had, but years of dealing with monkeys had given her an insight into\nthe infant mentality she had never grasped before. The baby cooed and wet itself with pleasure. The\nWitch handed it back quickly before the wet could soak through her skirt.\n\u201cRegardless of the shoes,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cdo you think a child like that should be sent\nunarmed straight into the jaws of the Wizard? Has she been told what a monster he is?\u201d\nBoq looked uncomfortable. \u201cWell, Elphie, I don\u2019t like speaking ill of\nthe Wizard. I\u2019m afraid there are too many pitchers with big ears in this community, and you\nnever know who is on what side. Between you and me, I hope Nessa\u2019s death will result in some sort\nof a sensible government, but if we are overrun with an invading army in two months I wouldn\u2019t\nwant it bruited about that I\u2019d been bad-mouthing the invaders. And there are rumors of reunffication.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re hoping for that,\u201d she said, \u201cnot you too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hoping for anything, except for peace and quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cI have enough trouble\ngetting crops out of these rocky fields. That\u2019s what I was in Shiz to learn, do you remember?agriculture. I\u2019ve put the best of my efforts into our small holdings, and we only manage to eke out a\nliving.\u201d\nBut he looked rather proud about it, and so did Milla.\n\u201cAnd I guess you have a couple of Cows in your barn,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re testy. Of course we don\u2019t. Do you think I could forget what we worked for-you and\nCrope and Tibbett and I? It was the high point of a very quiet life.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to have a quiet life, Boq,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be superior. I didn\u2019t say I was sorry for it, neither the excitement of a righteous\ncampaign nor the relief of a family and a farm. Did we ever do any good back then?\u201d\n\u201cIf nothing else,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cwe helped Doctor Dillamond. He was very much alone in his\nwork, you know. And the philosophical basis for the resistance grew out of his pioneering\nhypotheses. His findings outlived him; they still do.\u201d She did not mention her own experiments with\nthe winged monkeys. Her practical applications were directly derived from Doctor Dillamond\u2019s\ntheories.\n\n\f\u201cWe had no idea we were at the end of a golden age,\u201d Boq said, sighing. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time\nyou saw an Animal in the professions?\u201d\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t get me started,\u201d the Witch said. She couldn\u2019t stay seated.\n\u201cDo you remember, you hoarded those notes of Dillamond\u2019s. You never really let me know\nwhat they were all about. Did you make any use of them?\u201d\n\u201cI learned enough from his research to keep questioning,\u201d said the Witch, but she felt\nbombastic, and wanted to stop talking. It made her\nfeel too sad, too desperate. Milla saw this, and with a brusque charity declared, \u201cThose times\nare over and gone, and good riddance to them, too. We were hopelessly high-spirited. Now we\u2019re\nthe thick-waisted generation, dragging along our children behind us and carrying our parents on our\nbacks. And we\u2019re in charge, while the figures who used to command our respect are wasting away.\u201d\n\u201cThe Wizard doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cWell, Madame Morrible does,\u201d said Milla. \u201cOr so Shenshen told me in her last letter.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Boq. \u201cThough from her bed of pain Madame Morrible continues to\nadvise our Emperor Wizard on policy matters about education. I\u2019m surprised that Glinda didn\u2019t send\nDorothy to Shiz to study with Madame Morrible. Instead she directed her to the Emerald City.\u201d\nThe Witch could not picture Dorothy, but for a moment she saw the stooped figure of Nor. She\nsaw a crowd of girls like Nor, in chains and yokes, drifting around Madame Morrible the way those\nschoolgirls had, all those years ago.\n\u201cElphie, sit down again, you don\u2019t look well,\u201d said Boq. \u201cThis is a hard time for you. You\ndidn\u2019t get along well with Nessarose, I seem to remember.\u201d\nBut the Witch didn\u2019t want to think of her sister. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather ugly name, Dorothy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d She sat back down heavily, and Boq relaxed on a stool a few feet away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cActually we had a chat about it. She said that the King of her\nhomeland was a man named Theodore. Her teacher explained that the name meant Gift of God, and\nthat this was a sign that he was ordained to be King or Prime Minister. Dorothy remarked that\nDorothy was a sort of backward Theodore, but the teacher looked it up and said no, Dorothy meant\nGoddess of Gifts.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know what she can give me,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cShe can give me my shoes. Are you\ntrying to say that you think she was a gift of God, or that she is some sort of queen or goddess? Boq,\nyou used not to go in for superstition.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything of the sort. I\u2019m having a conversation on word derivations,\u201d he\nanswered calmly. \u201cLet others more enlightened\nthan I ferret out the hidden meanings of life. But I do think it interesting that her name so\nresembles the name of her king.\u201d\nMilla said, \u201cWell, I think she\u2019s a holy little girl, ordinary and sanctified just as any child is, no\nmore no less. Yellowgage, get your paws off that lemon tart, I can see you from here, or I\u2019ll whip\nyou from now to eternity. The Dorothy child reminded me of what Ozma might have been like, or\nmight yet be like, if she ever comes out of the deep sleep she\u2019s supposed to be enchanted into.\u201d\n\u201cShe sounds like a little fright,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cOzma, Dorothy- all this talk about savior\nchildren. I have always detested it.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d said Boq, think\u00f1 g carefully. \u201cSince we\u2019re talking about the old days, it\ncomes back to me . . . I wonder if you remember that medieval painting I once found in the library at\nThree Queens? The one with the female figure cradling the beast? There was a sort of tenderness and\nawfulness in that painting. Well, there\u2019s something in Dorothy that reminds me of that unnamed\nfigure. You might even call it the Unnamed Goddess-is that sacrilegious or what? Dorothy has this\n\n\fsweet charity toward her dog, a pretty dreadful little beast. And whiffy? You wouldn\u2019t believe how\nrepugnant. Once she swooped the dog up in her arms and bent over it, crooning to it, in just the same\npose as that medieval figure. Dorothy is a child, but she has a heaviness of bearing like an adult, and\na gravity you don\u2019t often find in the young. It\u2019s very becoming. Elphie, I was charmed by her, to tell\nyou the truth.\u201d He cracked a couple of walnuts and eastern macarands, and passed them around. \u201cI\nam sure you will be, too.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to avoid her at all costs, at the sound of it,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m in\na mood for these days is to be charmed by juvenile purity. But I insist on recovering my property.\u201d\n\u201cThe shoes are very magic, are they?\u201d said Milla. \u201cOr is it just symbolic?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I even know?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever put them on. But if I could get them and\nthey could walk me out of this parlous life, I wouldn\u2019t be sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, everyone blamed the shoes for Nessa\u2019s tyranny. I think it\u2019s good of Glinda to have\ngotten them out of Munchkinland. The child is smuggling them abroad without even knowing it.\u201d\n\u201cGlinda has sent the girl to the Emerald City,\u201d said the Witch\npointedly. \u201cIf the Wizard gets hold of them, it\u2019ll be a license to march into Munchkinland. And\nyou\u2019re fools to sit on the fence as if it makes no difference whether he does or not.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay for something, at least some tea,\u201d said Milla soothingly. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve had Clarinda\nmake a fresh pot, and we\u2019ve saffron cream. Remember the saffron cream party after Ama Clutch\u2019s\nfuneral?\u201d\nThe Witch breathed heavily for a moment; there was a pain in her esophagus. She did not like to\nremember those trying times. And Glinda had known full well that Madame Morrible was behind the\ndeath of Ama Clutch. Now as Lady Glinda she was part of the same ruling class. It was hideous. And\nDorothy, whatever her origins, was still only a child, and they were using her to help rid\nMunchkinland of those damned totemic shoes. Or to get the shoes to the Wizard. Just as Madame\nMorrible had used her students as Adepts.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop here chattering like an idiot,\u201d she cried, startling them, spilling the bowl of nuts to\nthe ground. \u201cDidn\u2019t we waste enough time talking ourselves to death in school?\u201d She grabbed for her\nbroom and her hat.\nBoq looked startled and almost fell backward off his seat. \u201cWell, Elphie, why are you taking\noffense-?\u201d\nShe was beyond answering. She whirled in a small cyclone of black skirts and scarves, and ran\nout to the road.\nShe hurried on foot along the Yellow Brick Road, hardly realizing that a plan was forming in\nher mind. But she was thinking so hard that for a while she completely forgot she was carrying her\nbroom, and it was only when she paused to rest, and leaned on it, that she remembered it.\nBoq, Glinda, even her father, Frex: how disappointing they all seemed now. Had these folks\ndeteriorated in virtue since their youth, or had she been too naive then to see them for what they\nwere? She felt disgusted with people, and longed to be home. She was too out of sorts to seek\nlodging in an inn or a public house. It was warm enough to stay outside and rest.\nShe lay awake at the edge of a field of barley. The moon rose, huge as it sometimes is when\nfirst breaking over the horizon. It backlit a stake with a crossbar, standing as if awaiting a body to\ncrucify, or a scarecrow to hang.\nWhy hadn\u2019t she joined forces with Nessarose, and raised armies against the Wizard? Old\nfamily resentments had gotten in the way.\nNessarose had asked for help in governing Munchkinland, and the Witch had denied her\nrequest. Instead the Witch had gone back to Kiamo Ko these seven years. She had squandered the\nchance to merge forces with her sister.\n\n\fVirtually every campaign she\u2019d set out for herself had ended in failure.\nShe squirmed in the light of the moon, and at midnight, tortured by the thoughts of Nessa\u2019s\ndeath-the physical fact of being squished like a bug finally taking on some imaginative shape in the\nWitch\u2019s fantasies- she arose, and took a new path. Dorothy would no doubt follow the Yellow Brick\nRoad to the Emerald City, and someone as exotic as she could be easily located anywhere along the\nroute. The Witch would go and try to accomplish the task set out for herself fifteen years ago.\nMadame Morrible still waited to be killed.\nShiz was a money factory now. The Colleges, occupying an historic district, remained largely\nunchanged, but for some contemporary dormitories and flashy athletic buildings. Outside the\nuniversity district, however, Shiz had thrived in the war-alert economy. A huge monument in brass\nand marble, The Spirit of Empire, dominated what was left of Railway Square, and the air and light\naround it was cut off by hulking industrial buildings, spewing black columns of filth into the air. The\nbluestone was now grimestone. The air itself seemed warm and earnest-the ten thousand exhalations\nof a city panting every second to increase its wealth. The trees were shriveled and gray. And not a\nsingle Animal in sight.\nCrage Hall looked absurdly older and newer at once. The Witch chose not to bother the porter,\nand flew herself up over the wall into the kitchen garden, where once Boq had tumbled off an\nadjoining roof, almost into her lap. The back lawn beyond the orchard was gone, and in its place\nstood a stone structure, above whose gleaming poxite doors was carved THE SIR CHUFFREY\nAND LADY GLINDA CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC AND THE THEATRICAL ARTS.\nThree girls came hurrying down the path, chattering away, their books clutched close to their\nbosoms. They gave the Witch a start, as if they were ghosts of Nessarose, Glinda and herself. She\nhad to hold on to\nher broomstick and steady herself. She had not taken in how far she had come, how much she\nhad aged.\n\u201cI need to see the Head,\u201d she said, startling them.\nBut one recovered her youthful aplomb and pointed the way. The Head\u2019s office was still in\nMain Hall. \u201cYou\u2019ll find her in,\u201d they said. \u201cShe\u2019s always in at this hour of the morning, having tea by\nherself or with contributors.\u201d\nSecurity must be greatly relaxed if none of them questions my being in the kitchen garden,\nthought the Witch. All the better; I may even escape unstopped.\nThe Head had a secretary now, a plump older gentleman with a goatee. \u201cShe\u2019s not expecting\nyou?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see if she\u2019s free.\u201d He returned and said, \u201cMadame Head will see you now.\nWould you like to kave your broom in the umbrella stand?\u201d\n\u201cHow kind. No thanks,\u201d said the Witch, and walked through.\nThe Head rose from a leather armchair. She wasn\u2019t Madame Morrible anymore; she was a\nsmall pinky white woman with copper-colored curls and an energetic manner. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your\nname?\u201d she said politely. \u201cYou\u2019re an old girl, but I\u2019m a new one\u201d-she laughed at her own witticism,\nand the Witch did not-\u201cand I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t yet grasped the truth: dozens of old girls come back\nevery month to relive the pleasant moments of their growing up here. Please, may I have your name,\nand I\u2019ll call for some tea.\u201d\nWith some effort, the Witch said, \u201cI was called Miss Elphaba when I was here, more years ago\nthan I realized could be possible. In fact I won\u2019t take tea, I can\u2019t stay long. I was misinformed. I was\nhoping to see Madame Morrible? Do you know of her whereabouts?\u201d\n\u201cWell, is this good luck or is it bad?\u201d said the current Head. \u201cUp till very recently she has spent\npart of every semester in the Emerald City, consulting with His Highness himself, on education\npolicies through Loyal Oz. But she\u2019s recently returned to her retirement apartment in the Doddery-\n\n\fI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s a joke of the girls and it slipped out. It is called the Daughter Building, really, as it\nwas financed by the generous daughters of Crage Hall, our alums. You see, her health has\ndeteriorated, and-though I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings-I fear she is very near the end.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to pop in and say hello,\u201d said the Witch. Playacting had never suited her, and it was\nonly because the new Head was so young, such a fool, such a girl herself, that the Witch could get\naway with it. \u201cI was a great favorite of hers, you know; it would give her a wonderful surprise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll call Grommetik to take you there,\u201d said the Head. \u201cBut I should ask Madame Morrible\u2019s\nnurse first if she\u2019s up to a visit.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call Grommetik, I can find my own way. I will chat with the nurse, and I will only stop\nin for a moment. And then I\u2019ll come back here before I leave, I promise, and perhaps I can see my\nway clear to making a contribution toward the annual fund, or some little endowment drive you must\nbe mounting at present?\u201d\nTo the best of her recollection she had never lied before in her life.\nThe Doddery was a broad round tower, like a squat silo, sitting adjacent to the chapel in which\nDoctor Dillamond had been eulogized. A scout, passing by with buckets and brooms, told the Witch\nthat Madame Morrible was one flight up, behind the door with the Wizard\u2019s standard mounted on it.\nA minute later the Witch stood looking at the Wizard\u2019s standard. A balloon with a basket\nbeneath it, commemorating his spectacular arrival in the Emerald City, and crossed swords below.\nFrom a few feet away it looked like a huge skull, and the basket a leering jaw, and the crossed\nswords a forbidding .IC. The doorknob turned under her tug, and she entered the apartments.\nThere were several rooms, all cluttered with school memorabilia and tokens of esteem from\nvarious Emerald City institutions, including the Palace of the Emperor. The Witch passed through a\nsort of parlor, with a fire burning in it despite the warmth of the season, and a kitchen-scullery area.\nTo one side was a water closet, and the Witch could hear the sound of someone sobbing inside, and\nthe blowing of a nose. The Witch pushed a dresser against the door, and continued on into a sleeping\nchamber.\nMadame Morrible was propped halfway up in a huge bed shaped like a pfenix. A carved gold\npfenix neck and head emerged from the head\u2019 board, and the sides of the bed simulated the bird\u2019s\nwings. Its feet joined at the footboard. The idea of its tail feathers had apparently defeated the\ningenuity of the cabinetmaker, for there weren\u2019t any. It was a bird in an awkward position, actually,\nas if being blown backward through the air by\nThe Witch had waited fifteen years, but her timing was oil by five minutes. So the temptation to\ngo back and dismember Grommetik was intense. But the Witch resisted. She didn\u2019t care if she was\nsentenced and executed for the battery of Madame Morrible\u2019s corpse, but she didn\u2019t want to be\ncaught because of vengeance against a machine.\nShe took a meal at a caf and glanced at the tabloids. Then she wandered in the shopping\ndistrict. Never one for frippery, she was intensely bored, but she wanted to hear them talking about\nthe death of Madame Morrible. She was waiting for the reviews, as it were. And she would never\ncome back to Shiz, she suspected, nor to any other city. This was her last chance to see Loyal Oz in\naction.\nAs the afternoon wore on, however, she began to worry. What if there\ngunshot, or as if laboring in a human way to deliver itself of the great mound of flesh sitting on\nits stomach and reclining against its breast.\nOn the floor was a pile of the financial papers, and an old-fashioned pair of spectacles was set\non top of them. But the time for reading was past.\nMadame Morrible rested in a gray mound, her hands folded upon her belly, and her eyes open\nand shallow, without motion. She was still like a mammoth Carp, in all but the fishy smell-a candle\n\n\fhad been so recently lit that the stink of the match\u2019s sulfur still lingered in the room.\nThe Witch pulled at her broom. From the other room came a pounding on the door of the water\ncloset. \u201cDid you think you would always be safe by hiding behind schoolchildren?\u201d said the Witch,\nbeyond herself, beyond caring, and she raised her broom. But Madame Morrible made a sluggish,\nindifferent corpse.\nThe Witch struck Madame Morrible with the flat of the broom, on the side of the head and the\nface. It made no mark. Then the Witch searched the mantelpiece for the testimonial trophy with the\nbiggest marble base, and she bashed in Madame Morrible\u2019s skull with it, with a sound like a\nsplitting of firewood.\nShe left it in the old woman\u2019s arms. Its statement could be read by all, except the carved pfenix\nwho would be looking at it upside down. IN APPRECIATION OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE\nDONE, it said.\nwas a cover-up? What if the current Head, to avoid scandal, hushed up the news of the assault?\nEspecially a crime against one so close to the Emperor? The Witch began to fret that she would be\ndenied the credit for her deed. She racked her brains for someone to confess to, someone who would\nbe sure to rush to the authorities. What about Crope, or Shenshen, or Pfannee? Or, for that matter, the\nMargreave of Tenmeadows, nasty Avaric?\nThe town house of the Margreave was set out in the deer park at the edge of Shiz. It was late\nafternoon by the time she reached the Emperor\u2019s Green, as it was now called. Private residences\nwere dotted about the expanse, each protected by its own security force, high walls lined with\nbroken glass bottles, fierce dogs. The Witch had a way with dogs and high walls didn\u2019t bother her.\nShe welcomed herself over the wall onto a terrace, where a maid tending a floxflower bed had a\nconniption and resigned on the spot. The Witch found Avaric in his study, signing some documents\nwith a huge plumed pen, and sipping some honey-colored whiskey in a crystal glass. \u201cI said that I\nwon\u2019t come out for cocktails, you\u2019re on your own, can\u2019t you listen?\u201d he began, but then he saw who\nit was.\n\u201cHowever did you get in here without being announced?\u201d he said. \u201cI know you. Don\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you do, Avaric. I\u2019m the green girl of Crage Hall.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. What was your name?\u201d\n\u201cMy name was Elphaba.\u201d\nHe lit a lamp-the afternoon was darkening, or perhaps clouding over now-and they looked at\neach other. \u201cHave a seat, then. I suppose if society forces itself in one\u2019s study door, one has no\nfurther right to deny it. A drink?\u201d\n\u201cA wee one.\u201d\nAlone of them all, he, who had been too handsome to believe, had grown better looking. He\nwore his hair swept back; it was rich and full, the color of polished nickel, and he clearly had the\nbenefit of a life of exercise and rest, for his figure was strong and slim, his bearing erect, his color\ngood. Those born with advantages know how to capitalize on them, observed the Witch, after her\nfirst sip.\n\u201cTo what do I owe this honor?\u201d he said, seating himself across from her with a freshened drink\nin his own hands. \u201cOr is the whole world playing reprises today?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\n\u201cI had a walk at noon,\u201d he said, \u201cin the park, with my bodyguards, as usual. And I came across\na carnival entertainment set up there. It opens tomorrow, I think, and the park will be mobbed with\nclever students, household servants and factory workers, and with greasy gabbling families from\nLittle Glikkus. There were the usual cast of children caught up in the allure of a good circus act,\nmostly teenage boys helping out, no doubt having run away from tiresome families and small\n\n\fprovincial towns. But the guy in charge was a bloody little dwarf.\u201d\n\u201cBloody, how do you mean?\u201d asked the Witch.\n\u201cI mean offensive, pardon my slang. We\u2019ve all seen dwarves before, that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s\njust that I had seen this very dwarf before. I recognized him from years ago.\u201d\n\u201cFancy that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything more of it, but then you show up this afternoon from\nmore or less the same zone of memory. Weren\u2019t you there, yourself? Didn\u2019t you go with us to the\nPhilosophy Club that night, we got so drunk, and they had that charmed-sex thing, and that effeminate\nTibbett got so wasted and lost his mind and just about everything else when that Tiger. . . ? You\nwere there, surely.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was.\u201d\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you? Boq was, squiggly little Boq, and Pfannee, and Fiyero, I think, and some others.\nDon\u2019t you remember? There was that hag who called herself Yackle, and the dwarf, and they let us\nin, and they were so creepy? Anyway, doesn\u2019t matter-it\u2019s just-\u201c\n\u201cNot Yaclde,\u201d said the Witch. She dropped her drink. \u201cThis is insanity, my ears are having\ndelusions. Everyone is right, I\u2019m paranoid. No, Avaric, I refuse to admit you could remember\nsomeone\u2019s name for twenty years like that.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a balding gypsy woman with a wig, and sort of chestnutcolored eyes, in thick with\nthis dwarf. I don\u2019t know what he was called. Why shouldn\u2019t I remember it?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t remember my name.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t scare me half as much. In fact you never scared me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI was probably\npretty nasty to you. I was an asshole back then.\u201d\n\u201cYou still are.\u201d\n\u201cWell, practice makes perfect, and more than once I\u2019ve been called a perfect asshole.\u201d\n\u201cI came by to tell you that I killed Madame Morrible today,\u201d said the \\Vitch. She was so proud\nof the phrase; it seemed less false when said aloud. Maybe it was true. \u201cI killed her. I wanted\nsomeone who would be believed to know about it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, why ever did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, the reasons just reassemble themselves in different patterns every time I think about\nIt.\u201d She sat up a little straighter. \u201cBecause she deserved it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Avenging Angel ofJustice is now green?\u201d\n\u201cA pretty good disguise, don\u2019t you think?\u201d They both grinned.\n\u201cSo about this Madame Morrible, whom you claim to have killed? Did you know that she\ngathered your friends and associates together and gave us a little lecture after you\u2019d run away?\u201d\n\u201cYou were never my friend.\u201d\n\u201cI was too near to be excused. I remember the situation. Nessarose was mortified and shattered\nby the whole thing. Madame Morrible took out your records and read to us a profile of your\ncharacter as assessed by your various teachers. We were warned about your spikiness, your\nfrInginess, what were the words they used? I can\u2019t remember that, they weren\u2019t memorable words.\nBut we were told you might try to recruit us in some sort of juvenile attempt to galvanize some sort\nof student uprising. You were to be avoided at all costs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Nessarose was mortified, well, that figures,\u201d said the Witch grimly.\n\u201cGlinda too,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cShe went through another slide, like the one she went into after\nDoctor Dillamond fell on his magnifying lens-\u201c\n\u201cOh please, is that hoary old lie still in circulation?\u201d\n\u201c-oh all right, was brutally murdered by brigands unknown, have it your way. Brigands in the\nform of Madame Morrible, that\u2019s what you mean me to suppose. So why really did you do it?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cMadame Morrible had a choice. No one was better placed than she to see that her students got\nan education and not a brainwashing. By hooking up with the Emerald City, she sold out all her\nstudents who believed that a liberal education meant learning to think for themselves.\nBesides, she was a vile fiend, and she did conspire to have Doctor Dillamond murdered. No\nmatter what you say.\u201d\nBut the Witch stopped herself short, hearing in her words about\nMadame Morrible-she had a choice-an echo of what the Elephant\nPrincess Nastoya had once said to her: No one controls your destiny.\nEven at the very worst-there is always choice.\nAvaric was rattling on. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve had her murdered. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, as we\nboys used to chant on the playground, usually when we were on the ground with someone\u2019s knee on\nour groin. Why don\u2019t you stay for a meal? We\u2019ve got guests, a clever bunch.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can call the police? No thanks.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t call the police. You and I, we\u2019re above petulant justice like that.\u201d\nThe Witch believed him. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWho are you married to, by the way? Did you\nget married to Pfannee, or Shenshen, or someone else? I can\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever,\u201d said Avaric, pouring another finger of whiskey. \u201cI can\u2019t keep small details in my\nmind, never could.\u201d\nThe Margreave\u2019s pantry was fulsome, his cook a genius, and his wine cellar unparalleled. The\nguests tucked into snails and garlic, roast crest of fallowhen with cilantro and clementine chutney,\nand the Witch allowed herself a sumptuous helping of lime tart with saffron cream. The crystal\ngoblets were never empty. The conversation was exalted and loopy, and by the time the Margreavess\nled them to the comfortable chairs in the drawing room, the plaster applique on the ceiling seemed to\nswirl like the cigarette smoke.\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re flushed,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cYou ought to have been a tippler all along, Elphaba.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure red wine agrees with me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in no condition to go anywhere. The maid will do up one of the corner rooms. It\u2019s\nlovely, there\u2019s a view clear to the pagoda on the island.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for prepared views.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to wait for the morning papers, to see if they got it right? If they got it at all?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask you to send me one. No, I must go, I feel the need of some fresh air. Avaric-Madamefriends-it\u2019s been a surprise and I suppose a pleasure.\u201d But she felt grudging as she said it.\n\u201cA pleasure to some,\u201d said the Margreavess, who hadn\u2019t approved of the conversation. \u201cI think\nit improper to talk about evil all during a meal. It spoils the digestion.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but come,\u201d the Witch said, \u201cis it only in youth that we can have the nerve to ask ourselves\nsuch serious questions?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I stick with my suggestion,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cEvil isn\u2019t doing bad things, it\u2019s feeling bad\nabout them afterward. There\u2019s no absolute value to behavior. First of all-\u201c\n\u201cInstitutional inertia,\u201d claimed the Witch. \u201cBut whatever is the great attraction of absolute\npower anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I say it\u2019s merely an affliction of the psyche, like vanity or greed,\u201d said a copper\nmagnate. \u201cAnd we all know vanity and greed can produce some pretty astounding results in human\naffairs, not all of them reprehensible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absence of good, that\u2019s all,\u201d said his paramour, an agony aunt for the Shiz Informer.\n\u201cThe nature of the world is to be calm, and enhance and support life, and evil is an absence of the\ninclination of matter to be at peace.\u201d\n\u201cPigspittle,\u201d said Avaric. \u201cEvil is an early or primitive stage of moral development. All\n\n\fchildren are fiends by nature. The criminals among us are only those who didn\u2019t progress..\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a presence, not an absence,\u201d said an artist. \u201cEvil\u2019s an incarnated character, an\nincubus or a succubus. It\u2019s an other. It\u2019s not us.\u201d\n\u201cNot even me?\u201d said the Witch, playing the part more vigorously than she expected. \u201cA selfconfessed murderer?\u201d\n\u201cOh go on with you,\u201d said the artist, \u201cwe all of us show ourselves in our best light. That\u2019s just\nnormal vanity.\u201d\n\u201cEvil isn\u2019t a thing, it\u2019s not a person, it\u2019s an attribute like beauty . .\n\u201cIt\u2019s a power, like wind . .\n\u201cIt\u2019s an infection . .\n\u201cIt\u2019s metaphysical, essentially: the corruptibility of creation-\u201c\n\u201cBlame it on the Unnamed God, then.\u201d\n\u201cBut did the Unnamed God create evil intentionally, or was it just a mistake in creation?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not of air and eternity, evil isn\u2019t; it\u2019s of earth; it\u2019s physical, a disjointedness between our\nbodies and our souls. Evil is inanely corporeal, humans causing one another pain, no more no less-\u201c\n\u201cI like pain, if I\u2019m wearing calfskin chaps and have my wrists tied behind me-\u201c\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re all wrong, our childhood religion had it right: Evil is moral at its heart-the\nselection of vice over virtue; you can pretend not to know, you can rationalize, but you know it in\nyour conscience-\u201c\n\u201cEvil is an act, not an appetite. How many haven\u2019t wanted to slash the throat of some boor\nacross the dining room table? Present company excepted of course. Everyone has the appetite. If you\ngive in to it, it, that act is evil. The appetite is normal.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, evil is repressing that appetite. I never repress any appetite.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t have this talk in my drawing room,\u201d said the Margreavess, near tears. \u201cYou\u2019ve been\nbehaving all night as if an old woman hadn\u2019t been slaughtered in her bedclothes. Didn\u2019t she have a\nmother too? Didn\u2019t she have a soul?\u201d\nAvaric yawned and said, \u201cYou\u2019re so tender and naive. When it\u2019s not embarrassing it\u2019s quite\nappealing.\u201d\nThe Witch stood up, sat down quickly, and stood up again, aided by her broom.\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d asked the hostess with spirit.\nThe Witch shrugged. \u201cFor fun? Maybe evil is an art form.\u201d\nBut as she wobbled toward the door, she said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re all a pack of fools. You\nought to have turned me in instead of entertaining me all evening.\u201d\n\u201cYou entertained us,\u201d said Avaric broadly, gallantly. \u201cThis\u2019ll end up being the dinner party of\nthe season. Even if you\u2019ve been lying all evening about killing this old schoolmarm. What a treat.\u201d\nThe dinner guests drolly applauded her.\n\u201cThe real thing about evil,\u201d said the Witch at the doorway, \u201cisn\u2019t any of what you said. You\nfigure out one side of it-the human side, say- and the eternal side goes into shadow. Or vice versa.\nIt\u2019s like the old saw:\n\u2018What does a dragon in its shell look like? Well no one can ever tell, for as\nsoon as you break the shell to see, the dragon is no longer in its shell. The real disaster of this\ninquiry is that it is the nature of evil to be secret.\u201d\nThe moon was up again, a little less swollen than the night before. The Witch didn\u2019t trust\nherself to ride on the broom, so she meandered in a zigzaggy way across the greensward. She would\nfind a place to nap outside of the claustrophobia of a society den.\nShe came upon the construction that Avaric had talked about. It was an old, early tiktok thing, a\nsort of portable stupa made of carved wood and figurines, too variegated and numerous for the Witch\n\n\fto comprehend tonight. Perhaps there was a running board where she could rest underneath, a\nplatform elevated just a couple of inches off the dampish ground. She peered, and moved forward.\n\u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d\nA Munchkinlander, no, a dwarf, stood in her way. He had a cudgel in one hand, and was\nthwacking it into the thick leathery palm of his other hand.\n\u201cGoing to sleep, when I can,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you\u2019re the dwarf, and this is the thing Avaric talked\nabout.\u201d\n\u201cThe Clock of the Time Dragon,\u201d he said, \u201copen for business tomorrow night, and not until.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be dead and gone by tomorrow night,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cWell, gone anyway.\u201d She looked at it and straightened up, then something came back to her. \u201cI\nwonder how you knew Yackle,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOh, Yackle,\u201d he said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know Yackle? Not such a surprise.\u201d\n\u201cWas she killed today?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cBy any chance?\u201d\n\u201cNo chance,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d She was afraid, suddenly, after all this headiness of sorrow and violence.\n\u201cOh, the least significant little one,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d\n\u201cWho haven\u2019t I worked for?\u201d said the dwarf. \u201cThe devil is a very big\nangel, but a very little man. But I have no name in this world, so don\u2019t bother with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m drunk and disorderly,\u201d she said, \u201cand I cannot take any more riddles. I killed someone\ntoday, I can kill you too.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her, she was already dead,\u201d said the dwarf calmly. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t kill me, for\nI\u2019m immortal. But you try very hard at life, and so I will tell you this. I am the guardian of the book,\nand I was brought to this dreaded, forsaken land to watch over the book\u2019s history, to keep it from\ngetting back to where it comes from. I am not good, I am not bad; but I am locked here, condemned to\na deathless life to guard the book. I don\u2019t care what happens to you or anyone else, but I protect the\nbook: that is my charge.\u201d\n\u201cThe book?\u201d She was struggling to understand; she felt drunker the more she heard.\n\u201cWhat you call the Grimmerie. It has other names-no matter.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you take it, why don\u2019t you have it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t work like that. I am the silent partner. I work through events, I live on the sidelines, I\ndabble in causes and effects, I watch how the misbegotten creatures of this world live their lives. I\ninterfere only to keep the book safe. To some extent I can see what\u2019s coming, and to that extent I\nmeddle in the affairs of men and beasts.\u201d He jigged like a little fiend. \u201cYou see me here, you see me\nthere. Having second sight is a great advantage in the security business.\u201d\n\u201cYou work with Yackle.\u201d\n\u201cWe sometimes have the same intentions, and we sometimes do not. Her interest seems to be\ndifferent from mine.\u201d\n\u201cWho is she? What is her interest? \u2018Why do you hover at the edges of my life?\u201d\n\u201cIn the world I come from, there are guardian angels,\u201d said the dwarf, \u201cbut so far as I can work\nit out, she is an opposite number, and her concern is you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I deserve such a fiend? Why is my life so plagued? Who positioned her to influence\nmy life?\u201d\n\u201cThere are things I don\u2019t know, and things I do,\u201d said the dwarf. \u201cWho Yacide answers to, if\nanyone, if anything, is beyond my realm of knowledge or interest. But why you? You must know this.\nFor you\u201d-the\n\n\fdwarf spoke in a bright, offhand tone-\u201care neither this nor that-or shall I say both this and that?\nBoth of Oz and of the other world. Your old Frex always was wrong; you were never a punishment\nfor his crimes. You are a half-breed, you are a new breed, you are a grafted limb, you are a\ndangerous anomaly. Always you were drawn to the composite creatures, the broken and\nreassembled, for that is what you are. Can you be so dull that you have not figured this out?\u201d\n\u201cShow me something,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not know what you mean. Show me something the world\nhasn\u2019t shown me yet.\u201d\n\u201cFor you, a pleasure.\u201d He disappeared, and there was the sound of mechanical parts being\nwound up, moving against one another, the grind of lubricated gears, the slap of leather belts, the\nchuck-chuck of pendulums swinging. \u201cA private audience with the Time Dragon itself.\u201d\nAt the top, a beast prowled, flexing its wings in a dance of gestures, both bidding welcome and\nholding at bay. The Witch stared.\nA small area halfway up was illuminated. \u201cA three-act play,\u201d came the voice of the dwarf, from\ndeep within. \u201cAct One: The Birth of Holiness.\u201d\nLater she could not have said how she knew what it was, but what she saw, in an abbreviated\npantomime, was the life of Saint Aelphaba. The good woman, the mystic and recluse, who\ndisappeared to pray behind a waterfall. The Witch flinched to see the saint walk straight through the\nwaterfall (a guttering spout overhead drained real water out into a hidden tray below). She waited\nfor the tiktok saint to come out, but she didn\u2019t come, and eventually the lights went out.\n\u201cAct Two: The Birth of Evil.\u201d\n\u201cWait, the Saint didn\u2019t emerge as the tales say she did,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI want my money\u2019s\nworth or not at all, please.\u201d\n\u201cAct Two: The Birth of Evil.\u201d\nlights came up on another little stage. There was a credible lIkeness of Coiwen Grounds\npainted on a cardboard backdrop beyond. A figurine who was Melena kissed her parents good-bye\nand went off with Frex, a handsome little puppet with a short black beard and a jaunty step. They\nstopped in a small hut, and Frex kissed her and continued on to preach. All through the rest of the\nscene he was off to one side, yammering away to some peasants who were busy screwing each other\non the ground before him, hacking each other to pieces arid eating theIr sexual parts, which ran with\na real gravy; you\ncould smell the garlic and sauteed mushrooms. Melena, at home, yawned and waited, and\nteased her pretty hair. Along came a man whom the Witch could not Identify at first. He had a small\nblack bag and from it he extracted a green glass bottle. He gave it to Melena to drink, and when she\nhad, she fell into his arms, either stupefied and drunk as the Witch was tonight, or liberated. It wasn\u2019t\nclear. The traveler and Melena made love in the same bouncy rhythm as Frex\u2019s parishioners. Frex\nstarted to dance to the rhythm himself. Then, when the act of love was done, the traveler pulled\nhimself off Melena. He snapped his fingers, and a balloon with a basket beneath descended from the\nfly space above. The traveler got in. It was the Wizard.\n\u201cOh, nonsense,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cThis is pure poppycock.\u201d\nThe lights dimmed. The voice of the dwarf sounded from inside the contraption. \u201cAct Three,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThe Marriage of the Sacred and the Wicked.\u201d\nShe waited, but no area was illuminated, no puppet moved.\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said.\n\u201cWell what?\u201d he answered.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the end of the play?\u201d\nHe stuck his head out of a trap door and winked at her. \u201cWho said the end was written yet?\u201d he\nanswered, and slammed the door shut. Another door opened, just by the Witch\u2019s hand, and a tray slid\n\n\fout. Lying on it was an oval looking glass, cracked along one side, scratched on its surfaces. It\nlooked like the glass she had had since childhood, the one she used to imagine she could see the\nOther Land in, back when she believed in such a thing. The last she remembered of the oval glass\nwas in her hideaway digs in the Emerald City. Inside the glass lived reflections of a young and\nbeautiful Fiyero, and a young and impassioned Fae. The Witch took the mirror and hid it in her\napron, and wandered away.\nThere was nothing in the morning papers about the death of Madame Morrible. The Witch, with\na treacherous headache, decided that she could wait no longer. Either Avaric and his beastly\ncompanions would spread the rumors, or they wouldn\u2019t There was nothing left to be done.\nJust let word get to the Wizard, though, said the Witch to herself. I would like to be a fly on the\nwall of his bunker when that happens. Let him think I killed her. Let that be how the news goes.\nShe returned to Munchkinland in a punishing journey, exhausting herself. She had slept so little,\nand her head still throbbed. But she was proud of herself. She arrived in the front yard of Boq\u2019s\ncottage, and called for the family to come.\nBoq was out in the field, and one of his children had to be dispatched to fetch hIm. When he\ncame running, he had an adze in one hand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you, it took me a minute,\u201d he said,\npanting.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have run quicker if you\u2019d left your blade behind,\u201d she noted.\nBut he didn\u2019t drop it. \u201cElphie, why have you come back?\u201d\n\u201cTo tell you what I have done,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you would like to know. I have killed\nMadame Morrible, and she can no longer harm anyone.\u201d\nBut Boq did not look pleased. \u201cYou took against that old woman?\u201d he said. \u201cSurely she was\nbeyond the point of hurting anyone now?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made the mistake that everyone makes,\u201d said the Witch, cruelly disappointed. \u201cDon\u2019t\nyou know there is no such point?\u201d\n\u201cYou had worked to protect the Animals,\u201d said Boq. \u201cBut you did not intend to sink to the level\nof those who brutalized them.\u201d\n\u201cI have fought fire with fire,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cand I ought to have done it sooner! Boq, you\u2019ve\nbecome an equivocating fool.\u201d\n\u201cChildren,\u201d said Boq, \u201crun inside and find your mother.\u201d\nHe was scared of her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on the fence,\u201d she said. \u201cHere your precious Munchkinland is going to be\nsucked back into the folds of Royal Oz, under His Highness the Emperor Wizard. And you see what\nGlinda is up to, and you send that child on her way with the shoes that belong to me. You took a\nstand when you were young, Boq! How can you have-spoiled so!\u201d\n\u201cElphie,\u201d said Boq, \u201clook at me. You are beside yourself. Have you been drinking? Dorothy is\njust a child. You may not retell this to make her into some sort of fiend!\u201d\nMilla, alerted to the tension in the front yard, came out and stood behind Boq. She carried a\nkitchen knife. Whispering noisily, the children watched from the window.\n\u201cYou do not need to defend yourselves with knives and adzes,\u201d said the Witch coldly. \u201cI had\nthought you would care to know about Madame Morrible.\u201d\n\u201cYou are shaking,\u201d said Boq. \u201cLook, I will put down this thing. Clearly you are upset. Nessa\u2019s\ndeath has been hard on you. But you must get control of yourself, Elphie. Don\u2019t take against Dorothy.\nShe is an innocent creature. She\u2019s all alone. I beg of you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t beg, don\u2019t beg,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cI could not abide begging, from you, of all people!\u201d\nShe ground her teeth and clenched her fists. \u201cI will promise you nothing, Boq!\u201d\nAnd this time she got on her broom and flew away. Recklessly, she mounted the sides of air\n\n\fcurrents, until the ground below had lost any detail sharp enough to cause her pain.\nShe was beginning to feel too long away from Kiamo Ko. Liir was an idiot, headstrong and lilylivered by turns, and Nanny sometimes forgot where she was. The Witch didn\u2019t want to think about\nyesterday, the death of Madame Mornble, the accusations made by the puppet play. She could hardly\nbe more averse to the Wizard than she already was; if there was a shred of possibility to that sick\nidea of his having fathered her, it only made her hate him the more. She would ask Nanny about it\nwhen she got home.\nWhen she got home. She was thirty-eight, and just realizing what it felt like to have a sense of\nhome. For that, Sarima, thank you, she thought. Maybe the definition of home is the place where you\nare never forgiven, so you may always belong there, bound by guilt. And maybe the cost of belonging\nis worth it.\nBut she decided to head toward Kiamo Ko by following the Yellow Brick Road. She would\nmake one last try for the shoes. She had nothing left to lose. If the shoes fell into the hands of the\nWizard, he would use them to bolster his claim to Munchkinland. Maybe, if she tried, she could\nshrug her shoulders and leave Munchkinland to its own fate-but damn it, the shoes were hers.\nShe finally found a peddler who had seen Dorothy. He stopped by the side of his wagon and\nrubbed the ears of his donkey as he discussed it with her. \u201cShe passed here a few hours ago,\u201d he\nsaid, chewing on a carrot\nand sharing it with the donkey. \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t alone. She had a ragamuffin crew of friends\nwith her. Bodyguards, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cOh, the poor frightened thing,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cWho? Munchkinlander beefcake boys, I\nwonder?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said the peddler. \u201cThere was a straw man, and a tin woodman, and a big cat who\nhid In the bushes when I passed-a leopard maybe, or a cougar.\u201d\n\u201cA man of straw?\u201d said the Witch. \u201cShe\u2019s awakening the figures of myth, she\u2019s charming them\nto life? This must be some attractive child. Did you notice her shoes?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to buy them from her.\u201d\n\u201cYes! Yes, did you?\u201d\n\u201cNot for sale. She seemed very attached to them. They were given her by a Good Witch.\u201d\n\u201cPigspittle, they were.\u201d\n\u201cNone of my affair either way,\u201d said the peddler. \u201cCan I interest you in anything?\u201d\n\u201cAn umbrella,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI\u2019ve come out without one, and it looks nasty.\u201d\n\u201cI remember the good old days of the drought,\u201d said the peddler, fishing out a somewhat worn\numbrella. \u201cAh, here\u2019s the bumbershoot. Yours for a nickel form.\u201d\n\u201cMine for free,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t deny a poor old woman in need, would you, my\nfriend?\u201d\n\u201cNot and live to tell about it, I see,\u201d he answered, and went on his way uncompensated.\nBut as the wagon passed, the Witch heard another voice: \u201cOf course, no one asks a beast of\nburden, but it\u2019s my opinion she\u2019s Ozma come out of the deep sleep chamber, and marching on Oz to\nrestore herself to the throne.\u201d\n\u201cI hate royalists,\u201d said the peddler, and lashed out with a crop. \u201cI hate Animals with attitude.\u201d\nBut the Witch could not stop to intervene. So far she had been unable to save Nor, she had been\nincompetent at bargaining with the Wizard. She had been a moment too late to murder Madame\nMorrible-or had she been just in time? Either way, she should not try what was clearly beyond her.\nThe Witch trembled on the lip of an updraft. She had brought the broom higher than ever before;\nshe was in a state of exhilaration and panic. Should she pursue Dorothy, should she snatch those\nshoes away-and what were her real motives? Was it to keep them out of the hands of the Wizard, just\n\n\fas Glinda had wanted them out of the hands of power-hungry Munchkinlanders? Or was it to snatch\nback some small shred of Frex\u2019s attention, whether she had ever deserved it or not?\nBeneath the broom, clouds began to gauze the view of rock-freckled hills and patchwork\nmeadows of melon and corn. The thin twists of vapor looked like the marks of erasure made by a\nschoolchild\u2019s rubber, streaking whitely along a watercolor sketch of a landscape. What if she should\njust keep on, urging the broom higher, yanking it up? Would it splinter as it beat itself against the\nheavens?\nShe could give up these efforts. She could forsake Nor. She could release Liir. She could\nabandon Nanny. She could surrender Dorothy. She could give up the shoes.\nBut a wind came up, a shoulder of hard air leaning onto her left side. She could not force the\nbroom against it. She was driven sideways, and down, until the Yellow Brick Road once again\netched a golden thread between forests and fields. There was a storm on the horizon, slotting bars of\nbrownish rain between lavender-gray clouds and gray-green fields. She hadn\u2019t much time.\nThen she thought she caught sight of them below, and dove down to see. Were they stopping to\nrest beneath a black willow tree? If so, she could finish things up now.\nBy the time the storm lifted-and the Witch awoke from what she now identified as a horrible\nhangover-she wasn\u2019t sure it was the same day. She wasn\u2019t even sure she had gotten near them-could\nshe have let them slip through her fingers like that? But whatever the case, delusion or foggy\nmemory, the Witch didn\u2019t dare follow them into the\n379\nEmerald City. Madame Morrible had many friends in this rotten regime, and the news would\nhave gotten through by now. There might even be search parties out for the Witch. So be it.\nThough it galled her, for the time being she had to give up on the idea of reclaiming Nessa\u2019s\nshoes. She scarcely rested during the entire trip back to Kiamo Ko, except to stop and pick some\nberries, and nibble some nuts and sweet roots, to keep her strength up.\nThe castle had not been burned down. The Wizard\u2019s reconnaissance army was still camped at\nits outpost near Red Windmill in a state of bored readiness. Nanny was busy crocheting a pretty\ncasket cover for her own funeral, and making guest lists. Most of the guests were already in the Other\nLand, presuming that for Nanny there was an Other Land. \u201cHow nice it would be to see Ama Clutch\nagain, I quite agree,\u201d shouted the Witch, giving Nanny\u2019s shoulders a squeeze. \u201cI always liked her.\nShe had more character than that simpering Glinda.\u201d\n\u201cYou were devoted to Glinda, you were,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cEveryone knew it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, no more,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cThe traitor.\u201d\n\u201cYou smell of blood, go wash up,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cIs it your time?\u201d\n\u201cI never wash, you know that. Where\u2019s Liir?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cLiir.\u201d\n\u201cOh, around somewhere.\u201d She smiled. \u201cLook in the fishwell!\u201d\nBy now an old family joke.\n\u201cWhat new nonsense is this?\u201d said the Witch, finding Liir in the music room.\n\u201cThey were right all along,\u201d he said. \u201cLook what I finally caught, after all these years.\u201d\nIt was the golden carp that had long haunted the fishwell. \u201cOh, I admit that it was dead and I\nbrought it up with the bucket, not a hook or a net. But even so. Do you think we\u2019ll ever be able to tell\nthem we finally caught it?\u201d\nAll these last months he had begun to talk about Sarima and the family as if they were ghosts,\nhiding just around the curve of the spiral staircase in the tower, suppressing giggles at this long, long\ngame of hide-and-seek.\n\n\f\u201cWe can only hope so,\u201d she said. She wondered, faintly, if it was\nimmoral to raise children in the habit of hope. Was it not, in the end, all the harder for them to\nadjust to the reality of how the world worked? \u201cEverything else was all right while I was gone?\u201d\n\u201cJust fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d\nShe grunted, and went to greet Chistery and the chattering kin.\nIn her room she hung the old glass with a cord and a nail, and kept from looking at it. She had\nthe horrible feeling that she would see Dorothy, and she didn\u2019t want to see her again. The child\nreminded her of someone. It was that unquestioning directness, that gaze unblinkered by shame. She\nwas as natural as a raccoon-or a fern-or a comet. The Witch thought:\nIs it Nor? Is it that Dorothy reminds me of how Nor was at this age?\nBut back then the Witch had not cared for Nor, not really, even though her face had been a\nsmall, velvet reworking of Fiyero\u2019s. Except for Nessarose, and Shell, the Witch had never warmed\nto the glowing promise of children. She had always felt more alone in this regard than in her color.\nNo-and now her glance did fall on the tired old looking glass, despite her intentions. She\nthought: the Witch with her mirror. Who do we ever see but ourselves, and that\u2019s the curse-Dorothy\nreminds me of myself, at that age, whatever it is . The time in Ovvels. There is the green girl, shy, gawky, and humiliated. To avoid the pain of\ndamp feet, splashing around in clammy leggings made of swampcalf hide and waterproof boots.\nMama, pregnant with Shell, huge as a barge. Mama praying nonstop for months that she might at last\nbring a healthy child into the world. Mama dumping the bottles of liquor and the pinlobble leaves\ninto the mud.\nNanny tends to little Nessa, papoosing her around in the daily hunt for charfish, needle flowers,\nand broad bean vines. Nessa can see but she cannot touch: what a curse for a child! (No wonder she\nbelieved in things she couldn\u2019t see-nothing is provable by touch.) For his atonement, Papa takes the\ngreen girl with him on an expedition to the relatives of Turtle Heart, a many-branched family living\nin a nest of huts and walkways suspended in a grove of broad, rotting suppletrees. The Quadlings,\nwho are more comfortable on their haunches, duck their heads. The smell of raw fish in their homes,\non their skin. They are frightened of the unionist\nminister, finding them out in their squalid hamlet. I have no firm memory of individuals, but for\none old matriarch, toothless and proud.\nThe Quadlings come up, after a period of shyness, not to the minister but to me, the green girl.\nShe is no longer I, she is too long ago, she is only she, impenetrably mysterious and dense-she stands\nas Dorothy stood, some inborn courage making her spine straight, her eyes unblinking. Her shoulders\nback, her hands at her side. Submissive to the stroke of their fingers on her face. Unffinching in the\ncause of missionary work.\nPapa asks forgiveness for the death of Turtle Heart, maybe some five years earlier. He says it is\nhis fault. He and his wife had both fallen in love with the Quadling glassblower. What can I give you\nto make up for it, he says. Elphaba the girl thinks he is mad, she thinks they are not listening, they are\nmesmerized by her weirdness. Please forgive me, he says.\nThe matriarch alone responds to these words; maybe she is the only one who actually\nremembers Turtle Heart. She has a look of someone caught venturing out from beneath a rock. Well,\nin a people whose moral code is so lax, so little is wrong. For her this encounter is a mysterious,\ncomplicated transaction.\nShe says something like, We don\u2019t shrive, we don\u2019t shrive, and not for Turtle Heart, no, and she\nstrikes Papa on the face with a reed, cutting him with thin stripes. I was only a witness, I was not\nreally alive then, but I saw:\nThis was when Papa began to lose his way, it dates from this whipping.\n\n\fI see him shocked: It doesn\u2019t occur in his conception of moral life that some sins are\nunforgivable. He blanches, onion white behind the blood-pearled perforations of her attack. Maybe\nshe has every right to do what she\u2019s done, but in Papa\u2019s life she\u2019s become old Kumbricia.\nI see her, willful, proud: Her moral system doesn\u2019t allow for forgiveness, and she is just as\nincarcerated as he, but she doesn\u2019t know it. She grins, all gums and menace, and rests the reed on her\ncollarbone, where its fetching tip falls like a necklace around her own neck.\nHe points to me, and says-not to me, but to them all-Isn\u2019t this punishment enough?\nElphaba the girl does not know how to see her father as a broken man. All she knows is that he\npasses his brokenness on to her. Daily his habits of loathing and self-loathing cripple her. Daily she\nloves him back because she knows no other way.\nI see myself there: the girl witness, wide-eyed as Dorothy. Staring at a world too horrible to\ncomprehend, believing-by dint of ignorance and innocence-that beneath this unbreakable contract of\nguilt and blame there is always an older contract that may bind and release in a more salutary way. A\nmore ancient precedent of ransom, that we may not always be tormented by our shame. Neither\nDorothy nor young Elphaba can speak of this, but the belief of it is in both our faces The Witch had taken the green glass bottle, whose label still read MIRACLE ELI-, and placed\nit on her bedside table. She took a spoonful of the ancient elixir before sleeping, hoping for miracles,\nseeking some version of the fabulous alibi Dorothy was unwinding, that she had come from a country\nsomehow other-not the real states across the desert, but a whole separate geophysical existence.\nEven metaphysical. The Wizard made such a claim for himself, and if the dwarf was right, the Witch\nhad this ancestry too. At night she tried to train herself to look on the periphery of her dreams, to note\nthe details. It was a little like trying to see around the edges of a mirror, but, she found, more\nrewarding.\nBut what did she get? Everything ffickered, like a guttering candle but more harshly, more\nstridently. People moved in short, jerky motions. They were colorless, they were vapid, they were\ndrugged, they were manic. Buildings were high and cruel. Winds were strong. The Wizard stepped\nin and out of these pictures, a very humble-looking man in this context. In one window, in a shop\nfrom which the Wizard was emerging rather dejectedly, she thought, she caught some words once,\nand willed herself with tremendous effort to wake up so she could write them down. But they didn\u2019t\nmake any sense to her. NO IRISH NEED APPLY.\nThen one night she had a nightmare. Again the Wizard began it. He walked over some hills of\nsand, with tall gray grasses blowing in a fierce gale-a thousand thousand grasses like the scratchy\nsedge with which the old Quadling matriarch had struck Frex-and the Wizard stopped along a broad\nflat stretch. He stepped out of his clothes, and looked at a timepiece in his hands, as if memorizing an\nhistoric instant. Then he walked forward, naked and broken. When the Witch realized what he was\napproaching, she tried to back out of the dream with a howl, but could not manage to disengage\nherself. This was the mythical ocean,\nand the Wizard walked into water up to his knees, his thighs, his waist; he paused and shivered,\nand slopped water over the rest of himself as a kind of penance. Then he kept walking, and\ndisappeared entirely into the sea, as Saint Aelphaba of the Waterfall had disappeared behind her\nwatery veil. The sea rocked like an earthquake, vomiting against the sandy shore, pounding in a\nkettledrum commotion. There was no Other Side to it. It threw the Wizard back, again and again,\nthough again and again he forged in, more and more exhausted. The stoicism, the determination: no\nwonder he had managed to overcome a nation. The dream ended with him washed back on shore one\nlast time, weeping with frustration.\nShe woke, gagging, terrified beyond telling, salt in her nostrils. Thereafter she avoided the\nmiracle elixir. Instead, she concocted a potion derived both from Nanny\u2019s recipe book and the\n\n\fGrimmerie\u2019s marginalia, on how to keep awake. If she fell asleep again, she would be prey to that\nvision of earthly destruction, and she would rather die.\nNanny didn\u2019t have very much to say about nightmares. \u201cYour mother had them too,\u201d she\nremarked at last. \u201cShe used to say she saw the unknown city of anger in her dreams. She was so\nenraged over how you turned out, you know-I mean physically, dear, don\u2019t look like that at me: a\ngreen girl isn\u2019t easy for any mother to explain away-that she gulped down those pills like candy\nwhen Nessarose was expected. If Nessarose were still around to take up a grudge, she could blame\nyou, in a way, for what happened to her.\u201d\n\u201cBut where did you get that green bottle?\u201d said the Witch into Nanny\u2019s good ear. \u201cLook at it,\nNanny dear, and try to remember.\u201d\n\u201cI suspect I bought it at a jumble sale,\u201d she said. \u201cI could stretch a penny, believe me.\u201d\nYou could stretch the truth even further, thought the Witch. She suppressed a desire to smash the\ngreen glass. How deeply bound by cords of family anger we all are, thought the Witch. None of us\nbreaks free.\nOne afternoon a few weeks later, Liir came back from a ramble all hot and bothered. The Witch\nhated to hear that he had been hobnobbing again with the Wizard\u2019s soldiers down in Red Windmill.\n\u201cThey had news, a dispatch from the Emerald City,\u201d he said. \u201cA\ndelegation of strangers got in to see the Wizard. And just a girl! Dorothy, they said, a girl from\nthe Other Land. And some friends. The Wizard hasn\u2019t allowed an audience with his subjects in\nyears-he works through ministers, they say. A lot of soldiers think he died long ago, and it\u2019s a Palace\nplot to safeguard the peace. But Dorothy and her friends got in, and they saw him, and told everyone\nwhat it was like!\u201d\n\u201cWell well,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cImagine that. All of Oz, Loyal and Otherwise, is yapping about\nthis Dorothy. What did the fools say next?\u201d\n\u201cThe dispatch soldier said that the guests asked the Wizard to grant them some wishes. The\nScarecrow asked for a brain, Nick Chopper the Tin Woodman asked for a heart, and the Cowardly\nlion asked for courage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I suppose Dorothy asked for a shoe horn?\u201d\n\u201cDorothy asked to be sent home.\u201d\n\u201cI hope she gets her wish. And?\u201d\nBut Liir got coy.\n\u201cOh come on, I\u2019m too old to be put off my supper by gossip,\u201d she snapped.\nLiir looked flushed with guilty pleasure. \u201cThe soldiers said that the Wizard had rejected the\nodd requests.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re so very surprised?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wizard told Dorothy that he would grant them their wishes-when they had-when they\nhad-\u201c\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t stuttered in years. Don\u2019t start again, or I\u2019ll beat you.\u201d\n\u201cDorothy and his friends have to come here and kill you,\u201d he finished. \u201cThe soldiers said it\u2019s\nbecause you murdered an old lady in Shiz, a famous old lady, and you\u2019re an assassin. Also you\u2019re\ncrazy, they said.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a more likely murderer than those incompetent vagabonds could be,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was\njust trying to get rid of them. Probably he\u2019s instructed his own Gale Forcers to slit the girl\u2019s throat as\nsoon as she\u2019s safely out of the limelight.\u201d And no doubt the Wizard had confiscated the shoes. It\ngalled her. But how flattered she felt that the news of her attack had gotten out. By now she was sure\nshe had killed Madame Morrible. It only made sense that she had.\nBut Liir shook his head. \u201cThe funny thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Dorothy is called Dorothy Gale.\n\n\fThe soldiers at Red Windmill said the Gale Forcers wouldn\u2019t touch her, they\u2019re too superstitious.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do these soldiers know of intrigue, stationed here out at the edge of the moon?\u201d\nLiir shrugged. \u201cAren\u2019t you impressed that the Wizard of Oz even knows who you are? Are you\na murderer?\u201d\n\u201cOh Liir, you\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older. Or anyway not understanding will become\nsecond nature, and it won\u2019t matter. I wouldn\u2019t harm you, if that\u2019s what you mean. But you sound so\nsurprised that I should be known in the Emerald City. Just because you disobey me and treat me like\nrefuse, do you think the whole world does?\u201d Yet she was pleased. \u201cBut you know, Liir, if there\u2019s\neven the slightest chance that there\u2019s any truth to these rumors, you had better stay away from Red\nWindmill for a while. They might kidnap you and hold you for ransom until I give myself up to this\nschoolgirl and her needy companions.\u201d\n\u201cI want to meet Dorothy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not that age already, please preserve us,\u201d she said. \u201cI always intended to pickle you\nbefore you got to puberty.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not getting kidnapped, so don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, I want to be here when\nthey get here.\u201d\n\u201cWorry is the last thing I\u2019d do if you got kidnapped,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019d be your own damn\nfault, and a great relief to me to have one less mouth to feed.\u201d\n\u201cOh well, then who\u2019d carry the firewood up all those stairs every winter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hire that Nick Chopper fellow. His axe looks pretty sharp to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him?\u201d Liir\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cI have, as a matter of fact,\u201d she said. \u201cWho says I don\u2019t travel in the best circles?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d he said, his face eager and bright. \u201cYou must have seen Dorothy too. What\u2019s\nshe like, Auntie Witch?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you Auntie me, you know that makes me sick.\u201d\nHe pestered without stopping until finally she had to screech at him. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful little\ndolt who believes everything everybody says to her! And if she gets here and you tell her you love\nher, she\u2019ll probably believe you! Now get out of here, I have work to do!\u201d\nHe lingered at the door, and said, \u201cThe lion wants courage, the Tin\nMan a heart, and the Scarecrow brains. Dorothy wants to go home. What do you want?\u201d\n\u201cA little peace and quiet.\u201d\n\u201cNo, really.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t say forgiveness, not to Liir. She started to say \u201ca soldier,\u201d to make fun of his\nmooning affections over the guys in uniform. But realizing even as she said it that he would be hurt,\nshe caught herself halfway, and in the end what came out of her mouth surprised them both. She said,\n\u201cA soul-\u201c\nHe blinked at her.\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d she said in a quieter voice. \u201cWhat do you want Liir, if the Wizard could give you\nanything?\u201d\n\u201cA father,\u201d he answered.\nShe wondered, briefly, if she was going insane. That night she sat up in a chair and thought\nabout what she had said.\nA person who doesn\u2019t believe in the Unnamed God, or anything else, can\u2019t believe in a soul.\nIf you could take the skewers of religion, those that riddle your frame, make you aware every\ntime you move-if you could withdraw the scimitars of religion from your mental and moral systemscould you even stand? Or do you need religion as, say, the hippos in the Grasslands need the\npoisonous little parasites within them, to help them digest fiber and pulp? The history of peoples\n\n\fwho have shucked off religion isn\u2019t an especially persuasive argument for living without it. Is\nreligion itself- that tired and ironic phrase-the necessary evil?\nThe idea of religion worked for Nessarose, it worked for Frex. There may be no real city in the\nclouds, but dreaming of it can enliven the spirit.\nPerhaps in our age\u2019s generous attempt at unionism, allowing all devotional urges life and breath\nunder the canopy of the Unnamed God, perhaps we have sealed our own doom. Perhaps it\u2019s time to\nname the Unnamed God, even feebly and in our own wicked image, that we may at least survive\nunder the illusion of an authority that could care for us.\nFor whittle away from the Unnamed God anything approximating\ncharacter, and what have you got? A big hollow wind. And wind may have gale force but it may\nnot have moral force; and a voice in a whirl\u2019 wind is a carnival barker\u2019s trick.\nMore appealing-she now saw, for once-the old-timers\u2019 notions of paganism. Lurlina in her fairy\nchariot, hovering just out of sight in the clouds, ready to swoop down some millennium or other and\nremember who we are. The Unnamed God, by virtue of its anonymity, can\u2019t ever be suspected of a\nsurprise visit.\nAnd would we recognize the Unnamed God if it knocked on our doors?\nSometimes she napped, against her will, her chin sagging on her chest, sometimes driving right\ndown to the tabletop, jarring her teeth and\nrattling her jaw, and startling herself awake.\nShe had taken to standing at the window, looking down in the valley. It would be weeks before\nDorothy and her band arrived, if indeed they hadn\u2019t already been murdered and their corpses burned,\njust as Sarima\u2019s must have been.\nOne night LIir came back from a visit to the barracks. He was teary and inarticulate, and she\ntried not to care about it, but was too curious to let it go. Finally he told her. One of the soldiers had\nproposed to his fellows that when Dorothy and friends arrive, the friends be killed and Dorothy be\ntied up for a little amusement among the lonely, randy men.\n\u201cOh, men will have their fantasies,\u201d said the Witch, but she was troubled.\nWhat had made Liir cry was that his friends had reported the soldier\u2019s remarks to their\nsuperior. The soldier had been stripped and castrated, and nailed to the windmill. His body rotated\nin circles as the vultures came and tried to peck at his entrails. He still wasn\u2019t even dead.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t hard to find evil in this world,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cEvil is always more easily imagined\nthan good, somehow.\u201d But she was struck at the vehemence of the Commander\u2019s response against\none of his own. So Dorothy might well be alive still, and was apparently under orders of protection\nfrom the highest military offices in the land.\nLiir held Chistery in his lap and sobbed onto his scalp. Chistery said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll wail while\nwoe\u2019ll wheel,\u201d and he cried along with Liir.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they the sweet pair,\u201d observed Nanny. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that make the sweetest painting?\u201d\nUnder cover of darkness the Witch slipped away on her broom, and saw to it that the suffering\nsoldier died at once.\nShe thought one afternoon, inexplicably, of the baby lion cub taken from its mother, and pressed\ninto service in Doctor Nikidik\u2019s lab back in Shiz. She remembered how it had cowered, she\nremembered the fuss she had made about it. Or was she only glorifying herself in hindsight?\nIf it was the same lion, grown up timid and unnatural, it should have no bone to pick with her.\nShe had saved it when it was young. Hadn\u2019t she?\nThey confused her, this band of Yellow Brick Road Irregulars. The Tin Woodman was hollow,\na tiktok cipher, or an eviscerated human under a spell. The lion was a perversion of its own natural\ninstincts. She could deal with tiktok clockworks, she could handle Animals. But it was the\n\n\fScarecrow she feared. Was it a spell? Was it a mask? Was there merely some clever dancer inside?\nAll three of them were emasculated in some way or other, deluded under the spell of the girl\u2019s\ninnocence.\nShe could give the Lion a history, and think of him as that abused cub in a ShIz science hall. She\nsuspected that Nick Chopper was the victim of her own sister\u2019s spite and magic, casualty of the\nenchanted axe. But she had no way to place the Scarecrow.\nShe began to think that behind that painted cornmeal sack of a face, there was a face she would\nknow, a face she had been waiting for.\nShe lit a candle and said the words aloud, as if she really could do spells. The words blew\naside the taper of grayish smoke that rose from the fatty tallow. If they had any other effect in the\nworld than that, she didn\u2019t know it yet. \u201cFiyero didn\u2019t die,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was imprisoned, and he\nhas escaped. He is coming home to Kiamo Ko, he is coming home to me, and he is disguised as a\nscarecrow because he doesn\u2019t yet know what he will find.\u201d\nIt would take brains to think up such a plan.\nShe took an old tunic of Fiyero\u2019s. She called elderly Killyjoy and bade him sniff it well, and\nsent him down into the valley every day, so\nthat if the travelers showed up, Killyjoy would be able to find them, and lead them home\nrejoicing.\nAnd though she tried not to sleep, on occasion she could not help it; her dreams brought Fiyero\ncloser and closer to home.\nThere was a day, in the first gusts of autumn, that the banners and standards of the camp below\nwere shifted and bugles blew tinnily up\nthe slopes to the castle. By this the Witch guessed that the troupe had arrived in Red Windmill,\nand were being given a royal welcome. \u201cThey\u2019ve come so far, they won\u2019t wait now,\u201d she said. \u201cGo,\nKiHyjoy, go find them and show them the quickest way here.\u201d\nShe loosed the senior dog, and so strong were his exhortations that the entire pack of his kin\nwent racing along with him, howling with joy and frantic to do their duty.\n\u201cNanny,\u201d cried the Witch, \u201cput on a clean petticoat and change your apron, we\u2019ll have company\nby nightfall!\u201d\nBut the dogs didn\u2019t come back, all afternoon and into the gloaming, and the Witch could see\nwhy. With a telescopic eye in a cylindrical casing-invented by the Witch along the lines of Doctor\nDillamond\u2019s discovery about opposing lenses-she followed a shock of carnage. Dorothy and the\nLion trembled with the Scarecrow beyond while the \u2018Tin Woodman struck the heads of her beasts\none after the other with his axe. Killyjoy and his wolfy relations lay scattered like dead soldiers on a\nfield of retreat.\nThe Witch danced with rage, and summoned Liir. \u201cYour dog is dead, look what they did!\u201d she\ncried. \u201cLook and make sure that I didn\u2019t only imagine it!\u201d\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t like that dog very much anymore,\u201d said Liir. \u201cHe had a good long life, anyway.\u201d\nHe concurred, tremblingly, but then trained the glass on the slope again.\n\u201cYou fool, that Dorothy is not for messing with!\u201d she cried, slapping the instrument out of his\nhand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully on edge for someone about to have company,\u201d he said sullenly.\n\u201cThey are supposed to be coming to kill me, if you remember,\u201d she said, although she had\nforgotten that, as she had forgotten her desire for the shoes until she saw them again in the glass. The\nWizard had not demanded them of Dorothy! Why not? What fresh campaign of intrigue was this?\nShe wheeled about her room, whipping pages of the Grimmerie back and forth. She recited a\nspell, did it wrong, did it again, and then turned and tried to apply it to the crows. Though the\n\n\foriginal three crows had long since fallen stiffly from the top of the door frame, there were plenty of\nothers in residence still, rather inbred and silly, but suggestible in a stupid, moblike way.\n\u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cLook with your eyes more closely than I can, pull the mask off the Scarecrow\nso we can know who he is. Get them for me. Peck out the eyes of Dorothy and the Lion. And three of\nyou, go on ahead to the old Princess Nastoya, out there in the Thousand Year Grasslands, for the time\nis coming when we will be reunited, all of us. With the help of the Grimmerie, the Wizard may\ntopple at last!\u201d\n\u201cI never know what you\u2019re talking about anymore,\u201d said Liir. \u201cYou can\u2019t blind them!\u201d\n\u201cOh, watch me,\u201d snarled the Witch. The crows blew away in a black cloud and dropped like\nbuckshot through the sky, down the jagged precipices, until they came to the travelers.\n\u201cA pretty sunset, is there?\u201d said Nanny, coming up to the Witch\u2019s room in one of her rare\nforays, Chistery as always providing service.\n\u201cShe\u2019s sent the crows out to blind the guests coming for dinner!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s BLINDING THE GUESTS COMING FOR DINNER!\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s one way to avoid having to dust, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWill you lunatics hush up?\u201d The Witch was twitching as if with a nervous disorder; her\nelbows flapped, as if she were a crow herself. She gave out a long howl when she found them in the\nglass.\n\u201cWhat, what, let me see,\u201d said Liir, grabbing the thing. He explained to Nanny, because the\nWitch was almost beyond speech by now. \u201cWell, I guess the Scarecrow knows how to scare crows,\nall right.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s he done?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say,\u201d said Liir, glancing at the Witch.\n\u201cIt still could be him,\u201d she said at last, breathing heavily. \u201cYou might get your wish yet, Liir.\u201d\n\u201cMy wish?\u201d He didn\u2019t remember asking for a father, and she didn\u2019t bother to remind him.\nNothing had yet suggested to her that the Scarecrow wasn\u2019t a man in disguise. She would not need\nforgiveness if Fiyero had not died!\nThe light was failing, and the odd band of friends was making good time up the hill. They had\ncome without an escort of soldiers, perhaps because the soldiers really believed that Kiamo Ko was\nrun by a Wicked Witch.\n\u201cCome on, bees,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cwork with me now. All together on this one, honeys. We\nneed a little sting, we need a little zip, we want a little nasty, can you give us a little jab? No, not us,\nlisten when I talk to you, you simpletons! The girl on the hill below. She\u2019s after your Queen Bee!\nAnd when you\u2019re through with your job, I\u2019ll go down and collect those shoes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that old hag blathering about now?\u201d said Nanny to Liir.\nThe bees were alert to the pitch in the Witch\u2019s voice, and they rose to swarm out the window.\n\u201cYou watch, I can\u2019t look,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cThe moon is just like a pretty peach rising over the mountains,\u201d said Nanny with the telescope\nto her old cataracted eye. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put in some peach trees instead of all those infernal apples\nin the back?\u201d\n\u201cThe bees, Nanny. Liir, take that from her and tell me what happens.\u201d\nLiir gave a blow-by-blow recounting. \u201cThey\u2019re swooping down, they look like a genie or\nsomething, all flying in a big clump with a straggly tail. The travelers see them coming. Yes! Yes!\nThe Scarecrow is taking straw out of his chest and leggings, and covering the Lion and Dorothy, and\nthere\u2019s a little dog, too. So the bees can\u2019t get through the straw, and the Scarecrow is all in pieces on\nthe ground.\u201d\n\n\fIt couldn\u2019t be. The Witch grabbed the eyepiece. \u201cLiir, you are a filthy liar,\u201d she shouted. Her\nheart roared like a wind.\nBut it was true. There was nothing but straw and air inside the Scarecrow\u2019s clothes. No hidden\nlover returning, no last hope of salvation.\nAnd the bees, having none left to attack but the TIn Woodman, flung themselves against him, and\ndropped in black heaps on the ground,\nlike charred shadows, their stingers blunted on his fenders.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give our guests credit for ingenuity,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cWill you shut up before I tie your tongue in a knot?\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cI suppose I should start down and get some hors d\u2019oeuvres going, they\u2019ll be peckish after these\nordeals you\u2019re setting them,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cHave you an opinion as to cheese and crackers or fresh\nvegetables with pepper sauce?\u201d\n\u201cI say cheese,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cElphaba? What\u2019s your opinion?\u201d\nBut she was too busy doing research in the Grimmerie. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me, as always was the case,\u201d\nsaid Nanny. \u201cI get to do all the work. I\u2019m supposed to be teary with joy, at my age. You\u2019d think I\ncould rest my feet for once, but no. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.\u201d\n\u201cAlways the godfather, never the god,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cWill you two please have mercy on me! Now go on, Nanny, if you\u2019re going!\u201d Nanny headed\nout the door as fast as her old limbs could take her. The Witch said, \u201cChistery, let her go under her\nown steam, I need you here.\u201d\n\u201cSure, let me tumble to my death, delighted to be of service,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be\ncheese, for that.\u201d\nThe Witch explained to Chistery what she wanted. \u201cThis is foolish. It\u2019ll be dark before long,\nand they\u2019ll tumble over some cliff and die. The poor dears, I\u2019d rather not. I mean the Tin Woodman\nand the Scarecrow, they can tumble all they want, and not be much hurt, I imagine. A good tinsmith\ncould repair a battered torso. But bring me Dorothy and the Lion. Dorothy has my shoes, and I have a\nrendezvous with the Lion. We\u2019re old friends. Can you do this?\u201d\nChistery squinted, nodded, shook his head, shrugged, spat.\n\u201cWell try, what good are you if you don\u2019t try,\u201d she said. \u201cOff with you, and your cronies with\nyou.\u201d\nShe turned to Liir. \u201cThere, are you satisfied? I haven\u2019t asked them to be killed. They\u2019re being\nescorted here as our guests. I\u2019ll get the shoes and let them go on their way. And then I\u2019ll walk this\nGrimmerie into the mountains and live in a cave. You\u2019re old enough to take care of yourself. Good\nriddance to bad rubbish. Who needs forgiveness now? Well?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming to kill you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, and aren\u2019t you just breathless with anticipation for that!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll protect you,\u201d he said, uneasily, and then added, \u201cbut not to the extent of harming Dorothy.\u201d\n\u201cOh, go set the table, and tell Nanny to forget the cheese and crackers, and go with the\nvegetables.\u201d She shook her broom at him. \u201cGo, I tell you, when I tell you to go!\u201d\nWhen she was alone, she sank in a heap. Either phenomenal luck lay with these travelers, or\nthey had enough courage, brains, and heart among them to do quite well. She was taking the wrong\napproach, clearly. She should welcome the child, explain the situation nicely, and get the damned\nshoes while she could. With the shoes, with the help of the Princess Nastoya, maybe there would be\nvengeance against the Wizard yet. Anyway, the Grimmerie would be hidden. One way or the other.\nAnd the shoes removed outside the Wizard\u2019s reach.\nBut the shock of the death of her familiars made her blood run cold inside her. She could feel\n\n\fher thoughts and intentions tumbling over and over one another. And she wasn\u2019t really sure what she\nwould do when face-to-face with Dorothy.\nLohr and Nanny stood on either side of the doorway, smiling, when Chistery and his\ncompanions came down with an ill-judged whump, dumping their passengers onto the cobbles of the\ninner courtyard. The Lion moaned in pain and wept from vertigo. Dorothy sat up, clutching the small\ndog in her arms, and said, \u201cAnd where might we be now?\u201d\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Nanny, genuflecting.\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Liir, twisting one foot around the other and falling over into a bucket of water.\n\u201cYou must be tired after your long trip,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cWould you like to freshen up some\nbefore we have a little light meal? Nothing fancy, you know, we\u2019re way ofT the beaten track.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Kiamo Ko,\u201d said Liir, beet red and standing up again. \u201cThe stronghold of the Arjiki\ntribe.\u201d\n\u201cThis is still Winkie territory?\u201d said the girl anxiously.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d she say, the little poppins, tell her to speak up,\u201d said Nanny.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Vinkus,\u201d said Liir. \u201cVt/inkie is a kind of insult.\u201d\n\u201cOh goodness, I wouldn\u2019t want to offend anyone!\u201d she said. \u201cMercy, no.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a pretty little girl, all your arms and legs in the right place, and such delicate\nsensible inoffensive skin,\u201d said Nanny, smiling.\n\u201cI\u2019m Liir,\u201d he said, \u201cand I live here. This is my castle.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Dorothy,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m very worried about my friends- the Tin Woodman and the\nScarecrow. Oh, please, can\u2019t somebody do something for them? It\u2019s dark, and they\u2019ll be lost!\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t be hurt. I\u2019ll go get them tomorrow in the daylight,\u201d said Liir. \u201cPromise. I\u2019d do\nanything. Really, anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet, just like everyone else here,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cOh, Lion, are you all right?\nWas it terrible?\u201d\n\u201cIf the Unnamed God had wanted Lions to fly, he\u2019d have given them hot-air balloons,\u201d said the\nLion. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I lost my lunch somewhere over the ravine.\u201d\n\u201cWarm welcomes,\u201d Nanny chirped. \u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you. I\u2019ve worn my fingers to the\nbone, making a little something. It\u2019s not much, but everything we have is yours. That\u2019s our motto here\nin the mountains. The traveler is always welcome. Now let\u2019s go find some hot water and soap at the\npump, shall we, and then go in.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re too kind-but I need to find the Wicked Witch of the\nWest,\u201d Dorothy said. \u201cI said THE WICKED WiTCH OF THE WEST.\nI\u2019m so sorry to trouble you. And it looks like a perfectly wonderful castle.\nPerhaps on the way back, if my travels take me this way.\u201d\n\u201cOh, well, she lives here, too,\u201d said hr. \u201cWith me. Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s here.\u201d\nDorothy looked a little pale. \u201cShe is?\u201d\nThe Witch appeared at the doorway. \u201cShe is indeed, and here she is,\u201d she said, and came down\nthe steps at a clip, her skirts whirling, her broom hurrying to keep up. \u201cWell, Chistery, you did good\nwork! I\u2019m glad to see all my efforts haven\u2019t been for naught. You, Dorothy, Dorothy Gale, the one\nwhose house had the nerve to make a crash landing on my sister!\u201d\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t my house, in a legal sense, strictly speaking,\u201d said\nDorothy, \u201cand in fact it hardly belonged much to Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, except for maybe\na couple of windows and the chimney. I mean the Mechanics and Farmers First State Bank of\nWichita holds the mortgage, so they\u2019re the responsible parties. I mean if you need to be in touch with\nsomeone. They\u2019re the bank that cares,\u201d she explained.\nThe Witch felt suddenly, oddly calm. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to me who owns the house,\u201d she said. \u201cThe\n\n\ffact is that my sister was alive before you arrived, and now she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\u201cOh, and I\u2019m so very sorry about that,\u201d said Dorothy nervously. \u201cReally I am. I\u2019d have done\nanything to avoid it. I know how terrible I\u2019d feel if a house fell on Auntie Em. Once a board in the\nporch roof fell on her. She had a big bump on her head and sang hymns all afternoon, but by evening\nshe was her old cranky self.\u201d\nDorothy tucked her little dog under her arm and went up and took the Witch\u2019s hands in hers.\n\u201cReal!y I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to lose someone. I lost my parents when I was\nsmall, and I remember.\u201d\n\u201cGet off me,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cI hate false sentiment. It makes my skin crawl.\u201d\nBut the girl held on, with a ragged sort of intensity, and said nothing, just waited.\n\u201cLet go, let go,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cWere you close to your sister?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d she snapped.\n\u201cBecause I was very close to my Mama, and when she and Papa were lost at sea, I could hardly\nbear it.\u201d\n\u201cLost at sea, how do you mean,\u201d said the Witch, detaching herself from the clinging child.\n\u201cThey were on their way to visit my grandmama in the old country, because she was dying, and\na storm came up and their ship went over and broke in half and sank to the bottom of the sea. And\nthey drowned, every soul onboard.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so they had souls,\u201d said the Witch, her mind recoiling at the image of a ship in all that\nwater.\n\u201cAnd still do. That\u2019s all they have left, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cPlease will you not cling so. And come in for something to eat.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, you too,\u201d said the girl to the Lion, and it sulkily rolled onto its big padded paws and\nfollowed along.\nSo now we turn into a restaurant, thought the Witch darkly. What, shall I send a flying monkey\ndown to Red Windmill to engage a violinist, for mood music? What a most peculiar murderer she is\nturning out to be.\nThe Witch began to think about how she might disarm the girl. It was hard to tell what her\nweapons were, except for that sort of inane good sense and emotional honesty.\nDuring dinner Dorothy began to cry.\n\u201cWhat, she would have preferred the vegetables to the cheese?\u201d said Nanny.\nBut the girl would not answer. She set both her hands on the scrubbed oaken tabletop, and her\nshoulders shook with grief. Liir longed to get up and wrap his arms around her. The Witch nodded\ngrimly that he was to stay put. He whacked his milk mug hard on the table, in annoyance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very nice,\u201d Dorothy said at last, sniffling,\u201d but I am so worried for Uncle Henry and\nAuntie Em. Uncle Henry frets so when I\u2019m just a wee bit late from the schoolhouse, and Auntie Emwell, she can be so cross when she\u2019s upset!\u201d\n\u201cAll Aunties are cross,\u201d said Liir.\n\u201cEat up, for who knows when another meal will come your way,\u201d said the Witch.\nThe girl tried to eat, but kept dissolving in tears. Eventually Liir began to tear up, too. The little\ndog, Toto, begged for scraps, which made the Witch think of her own losses. Killyjoy, who had been\nwith her eight years, a fly-ridden corpse going stiff on the hill among all his progeny. She cared less\nabout the bees and the crows, but Killyjoy was her special pet.\n\u201cWell, this is some party,\u201d said Nanny. \u201cI wonder if I should have prettied things up with a\ncandle.\u201d\n\u201cKindle candle can dull,\u201d said Chistery.\n\n\fNanny lit a candle and sang \u201cHappy Birthday to You,\u201d to make Dorothy feel better, but no one\njoined in.\nThen silence fell. Only Nanny kept eating, finishing the cheese and starting on the candle. Liir\nwas turning white and pink by turns, and Dorothy had begun to stare blankly at a knothole in the\npolished wood of the trestle table. The Witch scratched her fingers with her knife, and ran\nthe blade along her forefinger softly, as if it were the feather of a pfenix.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d said Dorothy, lapsing into a monotone. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come\nhere.\u201d\n\u201cNanny, Liir,\u201d said the Witch, \u201ctake yourselves off to the kitchen. Bring the Lion with you.\u201d\n\u201cIs that old bag talking to me?\u201d Nanny asked Liir. \u201cWhy\u2019s the little girl crying, our food not\ngood enough for her?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Dorothy\u2019s side!\u201d said the Lion.\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know you?\u201d said the Witch in a low, even voice. \u201cYou were the cub they did\nexperiments with in the science lab at Shin long ago. You were terrified then and I spoke up for you.\nI\u2019ll save you again if you behave.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be saved,\u201d said the Lion petulantly.\n\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cBut you can teach me something about Animals in the\nwild. Whether they revert, or how much. I take it you were raised in the wild. You can be of service.\nYou can protect me when I go out of here with my Grimmerie, my book of magicks, my Malleus\nMaleficarum, my mesmerizing incunabulum, my codex of scarabee, fylfot and gammadion, my text\nthaumaturgical.\u201d\nThe Lion roared, so suddenly they were all jolted in their seats, even Dorothy. \u201cThunder at\nnight, devil\u2019s delight,\u201d observed Nanny, glancing out the window. \u201cI better take in the laundry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m bigger than you,\u201d said the Lion to the Witch, \u201cand I\u2019m not letting Dorothy alone with you.\u201d\nThe Witch swooped down and gathered the little dog in her arms. \u201cChistery, go dump this thing\nin the fishwell,\u201d she said. Chistery looked dubious, but scampered away with Toto under his arm\nlike a yapping furry loaf of bread.\n\u201cOh no, save him, someone!\u201d said Dorothy. The Witch shot out her hand and pinned her to the\ntable, but the lion had catapulted into the kitchen after the snow monkey and Toto.\n\u201cLiir, lock the kitchen door,\u201d shouted the Witch. \u201cBar it so they can\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Dorothy, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you, just don\u2019t hurt Toto! He\u2019s done nothing to you!\u201d She\nturned to Liir, and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let that monkey hurt my Toto. The Lion is useless, don\u2019t trust\nhim to save my little dog!\u201d\n\u201cDo I take it we\u2019ll have pudding by the fire?\u201d said Nanny, looking up brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s caramel\ncustard.\u201d\nThe Witch took Dorothy\u2019s hand and began to lead her away. Liir suddenly leaped over and took\nhold of Dorothy\u2019s other hand. \u201cYou old hag, let her alone,\u201d he shouted.\n\u201cliir, really, you pick the most awkward times to develop character,\u201d said the Witch wearily,\nquietly. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass yourself and me with this charade of courage.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right-just take care of Toto,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cOh Liir, take care of Toto, no matter\nwhat-please. He needs a home.\u201d\nLiir leaned over and kissed Dorothy, who fell against the wall in astonishment.\n\u201cRelease me,\u201d mumbled the Witch. \u201cWhatever my faults, I don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\nShe pushed Dorothy ahead of her into the tower room, and locked the door behind her. The long\nperiod of sleeplessness was making her head spin. \u201cWhat have you come for,\u201d she said to the girl. \u201cI\nknow why you have tramped all the way from the Emerald City-but go on, tell me to my face! Have\nyou come to murder me, as the rumors say-or do you carry a message from the Wizard, maybe? Is he\n\n\fnow willing to bargain the book for Nor? The magic for the child? Tell me! Or-I know-he has\ninstructed you to steal my book! Is it that!\u201d\nBut the girl only backed away, looking left and right, for an escape. There was no way out\nexcept the window, and that was a deadly fall.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cI am all alone in a strange land, don\u2019t make me do this,\u201d said the girl.\n\u201cYou came to kill me and then to steal the Grimmerie!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d\n\u201cFirst give me the shoes,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cfor they\u2019re mine. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t, they won\u2019t come off,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI think that Glinda put a spell on them. I\u2019ve been\ntrying to get them off for days. My socks are so sweaty, it\u2019s not to be believed.\u201d\n\u201cGive them me!\u201d snarled the Witch. \u201cIf you go back to the Wizard with them, you\u2019ll be playing\nright into his hands!\u201d\n\u201cNo, look, they\u2019re stuck!\u201d shouted the girl. She kicked at one heel with the other toe. \u201cLook,\nsee, I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m trying, they won\u2019t come off, honest, promise! I tried to give them to the Wizard\nwhen he demanded them, but they wouldn\u2019t come off! There\u2019s something the matter with them,\nthey\u2019re too tight or something! Or maybe I\u2019m growing.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no right to those shoes,\u201d said the Witch. She circled. The girl backed away,\nstumbling over furniture, knocking over the beehive, and stepping on the queen bee, who had\nemerged from the fragments.\n\u201cEverything I have, every little thing I have, dies when you come across it,\u201d said the Witch.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Liir down below, ready to throw me over for the sake of a single kiss. My beasts are dead,\nmy sister is dead, you strew death in your path, and you\u2019re just a girl! You remind me of Nor! She\nthought the world was magic, and look what happened to her!\u201d\n\u201cWhat, what happened?\u201d said Dorothy, pitiably playing for time.\n\u201cShe found out just how magic it was, she was kidnapped, and lives her miserable life as a\npolitical prisoner!\u201d\n\u201cBut so have you kidnapped me, and I asked for none of it, nothing. You must have mercy.\u201d\nThe Witch came near and grabbed the girl by the wrist. \u201cWhy do you want to murder me,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cCan you really believe the Wizard will do as he says? He doesn\u2019t know what truth means, so\nhe does not even know how he lies! And I did not kidnap you, you fool! You came here of your own\naccord, to murder me!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to murder anyone,\u201d said the girl, shrinking back.\n\u201cAre you the Adept?\u201d said the Witch suddenly. \u201cAha! Are you the Third Adept? Is that it?\nNessarose, Glinda and you? Did Madame Morrible conscript you for service to the hidden power?\nYou work in collusion: my sister\u2019s shoes, my friend\u2019s charm, and your innocent strength. Admit it,\nadmit you\u2019re the Adept! Admit it!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not adept, I\u2019m adopted,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI\u2019m sure not adept at anything, can\u2019t you tell that?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my soul come scavenging for me, I can feel it,\u201d said the Witch. \u201cI won\u2019t have it, I\nwon\u2019t have it. I won\u2019t have a soul; with a soul there is everlastingness, and life has tortured me\nenough.\u201d\nThe Witch pulled Dorothy back to the corridor, and stuck the end of her broom in a torch fire.\nNanny was hobbling up the stairs leaning on Chistery, who had some dishes of pudding on a tray. \u201cI\nlocked the whole lot of them in the kitchen until they stop their roughhousing,\u201d Nanny was muttering.\n\u201cSuch a hubbub, such a racket, such a wild rumpus, Nanny won\u2019t have it, Nanny is too old. They\u2019re\nall beasts.\u201d\nBelow, in the dusty recesses of Kiamo Ko, the dog barked once or twice, the lion roared and\n\n\fpounded against the kitchen door, and hr shrieked, \u201cDorothy, we\u2019re coming!\u201d But the Witch turned\nand shot out her foot, and toppled Nanny over. The old woman rolled and slid, oohing and woohing,\ndown the stairs, Chistery chasing after her in consternation. The kitchen door had burst its hinges,\nand the lion and Liir came tumbling out, falling over the big heap of Nanny at the foot of the stairs.\n\u201cUp, you, up,\u201d shouted the Witch, \u201cI\u2019ll have done with you before you have done with me!\u201d\nDorothy had wrenched herself free and dashed up the corkscrew stairs of the tower ahead of the\nWitch. There was only one exit, and that was to the parapet. The Witch followed in good speed,\nneeding to finish the deed before the Lion and Liir arrived. She would get the shoes, she would take\nthe Grimmerie, she would abandon Liir and Nor, and disappear into the wilderness. She would burn\nthe book and the shoes, and then she would bury herself.\nDorothy was a dark shape, huddled over, retching on the stones.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question,\u201d said the Witch, poking the torch up high, releasing\nspectres and ghosts among the shadows of the castellations. \u201cYou\u2019ve come hunting me down, and I\nwant to know. Why will you murder me?\u201d\nThe Witch slammed the door behind her and locked it. All the better.\nThe girl could only gasp.\n\u201cYou think they\u2019re not telling stories about you all over Oz? You think I don\u2019t know the Wizard\nsent you here to bring back proof that I was dead?\u201d\n\u201cOh, that,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cthat is true, but that\u2019s not why I came!\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be a competent liar, not with that face!\u201d The Witch held the broom up at an\nangle. \u201cTell me the truth, and when you\u2019ve finished, then I\u2019ll kill you, for in times like these, my little\none, you must kill before you are killed.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill you,\u201d said the girl, weeping. \u201cI was horror-struck to have killed your sister.\nHow could I kill you too?\u201d\n\u201cVery charming,\u201d said the Witch, \u201cvery nice, very touching. Then why did you come here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the Wizard said to murder you,\u201d Dorothy said, \u201cbut I never intended to, and that\u2019s not\nwhy I came!\u201d\nThe Witch held the burning broom even higher, closer, to look in the girl\u2019s face.\n\u201cWhen they said \u2026 when they said that it was your sister, and that we had to come here . . . it\nwas like a prison sentence, and I never wanted to - - . but I thought, well, I would come, and my\nfriends would come with me to help. . . and I would come.. . and I would say..\n\u201cSay what,\u201d cried the Witch, on the edge.\n\u201cI would say,\u201d said the girl, straightening up, gritting her teeth, \u201cI would say to you: Would you\never forgive me for that accident, for the death of your sister; would you ever ever forgive me, for I\ncould never forgive myself!\u201d\nThe Witch shrieked, in panic, in disbelief. That even now the world should twist so, offending\nher once again: Elphaba, who had endured Sarima\u2019s refusal to forgive, now begged by a gibbering\nchild for the same mercy always denied her? How could you give such a thing out of your own\nhollowness?\nShe was caught, twisting, trying, full of will, but toward what? A fragment of the brush of the\nbroom fluttered off, and lit on her skirt, and there was a run of flames in her lap, eating up the dryest\ntinder in the Vinkus. \u201cOh, will this nightmare never end,\u201d screamed Dorothy, and she grabbed at a\nbucket for collecting rainwater that, in the sudden fare-up of light, had come into view. She said, \u201cI\nwill save you!\u201d and she hurled the water at the Witch.\nAn instant of sharp pain before the numbness. The world was floods above and fire below. If\nthere was such a thing as a soul, the soul had gambled on a sort of baptism, and had it won?\nThe body apologizes to the soul for its errors, and the soul asks forgiveness for squatting in the\n\n\fbody without invitation.\nA ring of expectant faces before the light dims; they move in the\nshadows like ghouls. There is Mama, playing with her hair; there is Nessarose, stern and\nbleached as weathered timber. There is Papa, lost in his reflections, looking for himself in the faces\nof the suspicious heathen. There is Shell, not quite yet himself despite his apparent wholeness.\nThey become others; they become Nanny in her prime, tart and officious; and Ama Clutch and\nAma Vimp and the other Amas, lumped together now in a maternal blur. They become Boq, sweet\nand lithe and earnest, as yet unbowed; and Crope and Tibbett in their funny, campy anxiety to be\nliked; and Avaric in his superiority. And Glinda in her gowns, waiting to be good enough to deserve\nwhat she gets.\nAnd the ones whose stories are over: Manek and Madame Morrible and Doctor Dillamond and\nmost of all Fiyero, whose blue diamonds are the blues of water and of sulfurous fire both. And the\nones whose stories are curiously unfinished-was it to be like this?-the Princess Nastoya of the\nScrow, whose help could not arrive in time; and Liir, the mysterious foundling boy, pushing out of\nhis pea pod. Sarima, who in her loving welcome and sisterliness would not forgive, and Sarima\u2019s\nsisters and children and future and past\u2026\nAnd the ones who fell to the Wizard, including Killyjoy and the other resident creatures; and\nbehind them the Wizard himself, a failure until he exiled himself from his own land; and behind him\nYackle, whoever she was, if anyone, and the anonymous Adepts, if they existed, and the dwarf, who\nhad no name to share.\nAnd the creatures of makeshift lives, the hobbled together, the disenfranchised, and the abused:\nthe Lion, the Scarecrow, the maimed Tin Woodman. Up from the shadows for an instant, up into the\nlight; then back.\nThe Goddess of Gifts the last, reaching in among flames and water, cradling her, crooning\nsomething, but the words remain unclear.\nOz stretched out from Kiamo Ko a good several hundred miles to the west and north, and even\nfarther to the east and south. On the night the Wicked Witch of the West died, anyone with the eyes to\nsee so well could have looked out from the parapet. Westward, the moon was rising\nover the Thousand Year Grasslands. Though the peaceful Yunamata refused to join them, the\nAijiki clans and the Scrow were meeting to consider a pact of alliance, given the Wizard\u2019s armies\nmassing up in Kumbricia\u2019s Pass. The Arjiki chieftain and the Princess Nastoya agreed to send a\ndelegation to the Witch of the West, and ask for guidance and support. As they toasted her and\nwished her well, not an hour after her death, the messenger crows Elphaba had dispatched for help\nwere swooped upon by nocturnal rocs and devoured.\nThe moon ran silver up and down the sides of the Great Kells, and silver shadows settled in the\nvalleys of the Lesser Kells. The scorpions of the Sour Sands came out to sting, the skark of the\nThursk Desert mated in their nests. At the Kvon Altar practitioners of a sect so obscure that it had no\nname made their nightly oblations for the souls of the dead, assuming, as most do, that the dead had\nhad souls.\nThe Quadling Country, a wasteland of mud and frogs, rotted quietly all night, except for an\nincident in Qhoyre. A Crocodile entered a nursery and chewed up a small baby. The Animal was\ndestroyed, and both corpses were burned, with loud wailing and anger.\nIn Gilhikin, the banks turned over their money to keep it fresh and vibrant, the factories turned\nover their wares, the merchants turned over their wives, the students in Shiz turned over intellectual\npropositions, and the tiktok labor force met secretly, in what had used to be the Philosophy Club, to\nhear the freed and grieving Grommetik talk class revolution. Lady Glinda had a bad night, a night of\nshakes and regret and pain; she guessed it was the early signs of gout from her rich diet. But she sat\n\n\fup half the night and lit a candle in a window, for reasons she couldn\u2019t articulate. The moon passed\noverhead in its path from the Vinkus, and she felt its accusatory spotlight, and moved back from the\ntall windows.\nAcross the low ridge of hills known as the Madeleines, into the Corn Basket, looking into the\nwindows of Colwen Grounds, the moon continued its journey. Frex was asleep, dreaming of Turtle\nHeart and yes, of Melena, his beautiful Melena, making him breakfast on the day he went in to preach\nagainst the evil clock. Melena was a froth of beauty, huge as a world, spinning him courage, daring,\nlove. Frex hardly stirred when Shell tiptoed in, back from some clandestine rendezvous, and came to\nsit by the side of his bed. Shell wasn\u2019t sure he noticed, he wasn\u2019t sure\nhis father really woke up. \u201cWhat I never could understand was the teeth,\u201d mumbled Frex, \u201cwhy\nthe teeth?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows why?\u201d said Shell fondly, not understanding the dreamy murmur.\nThe moon on the Emerald City? It couldn\u2019t be seen; lights too bright, energy too high, spirits too\nwired. No one looked for it. In a room, surprisingly bare and simple for one so powerful and\nelevated, the sleepless Wizard of Oz wiped his brow, and wondered how long his luck would hold\nout. He had been wondering the same thing for forty years, and he had hoped that luck would begin to\nseem habitual, deserved. But he could hear the very mice chewing away at the foundations of his\nPalace. The arrival of that Dorothy Gale, from Kansas, was a summons, he knew it; he knew it when\nhe saw her face. There was no point in searching after the Grimmerie any longer. His avenging angel\nhad come to call him home. A suicide was waiting for him back in his own world, and by now he\nought to have learned enough to get through it successfully.\nHe had sent Dorothy, locked in those shoes as she was, to kill the Witch. He had sent a girl in to\ndo a man\u2019s job. If the Witch was the victor-well, that was the troublesome girl out of the way, then.\nPerversely, though, in a fatherly way, he half hoped Dorothy would get through her trials all right.\nIt became a celebrated event, the death of the Wicked Witch of the West. It was hailed as\npolitical assassination or a juicy murder. Dorothy\u2019s description of what had happened was deemed\nself-delusion, at best, or a bald-faced lie. Murder or mercy killing or accident, in an indirect way it\nhelped rid the country of its dictator.\nDorothy, more stunned than ever, made her way back to the Emerald City with the Lion, the Tin\nWoodman, the Scarecrow, and Liir. There Dorothy had her second famous audience with the\nWizard. Perhaps he again tried to pry the slippers off her for his own purposes, and perhaps Dorothy\noutwitted him, spurred by the Witch\u2019s warnings. At any rate, she presented him with something from\nthe Witch\u2019s house to prove that she had been there. The broom had been burnt beyond recognition,\nand the Grimmerie had seemed too cumbersome to carry, so she brought the green glass bottle that\nsaid MIRACLE EU- on the paper glued to the front.\nIt may merely be apocryphal that when the Wizard saw the glass bottle he gasped, and clutched\nhis heart. The story is told in so many ways, depending on who is doing the telling, and what needs\nto be heard at the time. It is a matter of history, however, that shortly thereafter, the Wizard\nabsconded from the Palace. He left in the way he had first arrived-a hot-air balloon-just a few hours\nbefore seditious ministers were to lead a Palace revolt and to hold an execution without trial.\nA lot of nonsense has been circulated about how Dorothy left Oz. There are some who say that\nshe never did; they say as they said of Ozma before her that she is in hiding, in disguise, patient as a\nmaiden, waiting to come back and show herself again. Others insist she flew up into the sky like a\nsaint ascending to the Other Land, waving her apron giddily and clutching that damn fool dog.\nLiir disappeared into the sea of humanity in the Emerald City, to hunt for his half-sister, Nor.\nHe was not heard of again for some time.\nWhatever may have happened to the original shoes, everyone remembered them as beautiful,\n\n\feven stunning. Well-fashioned name-brand imitations were always available and never went out of\nstyle for very long. The shoes or their replicas, with their suggestion of residual magic, cropped up\nat so many public ceremonies that, like the relics of saints, they began to multiply to fill the need.\nAnd of the Witch? In the life of a Witch, there is no after, in the ever after of a Witch, there is no\nhap pity; in the story of a Witch, there is no afterword. Of that part that is beyond the life story,\nbeyond the story of the life, there is-alas, or perhaps thank mercy-no telling. She was dead, dead and\ngone, and all that was left of her was the carapace of her reputation for malice.\n\u201cAnd there the wicked old Witch stayed for a good long time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did she ever come out?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\nThe End\n\n\fTable of Contents\nWicked - The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\nBook 1 - Munchkinlanders\nBook 2 - Gillikin\nBook 3 - City of Emeralds\nBook 4 - In the Vinkus\nBook 5 - The Murder and Its Afterlife\n\n\f"
